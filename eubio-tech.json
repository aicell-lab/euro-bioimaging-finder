It allows for chemically specific imaging of biological materials without use of fluorescent labels. CARS is a three-photon nonlinear optical process where two synchronous and spatially overlapped optical beams are used to probe molecular vibrations in the sample material. The method is based on stimulated Raman scattering which makes CARS imaging much faster than confocal Raman mapping based on spontaneous Raman scattering (at least 100 times faster). Different experimental realizations of CARS microscopy exist. Typical is the visualization of a selected single vibrational frequency, for example the CH2 symmetric stretching mode around 2800 cm-1. Spectral scanning is realized by tuning the excitation wavelength step-by-step. The alternative approach is hyperspectral CARS which is based on broadband excitation and detection of vibrational frequencies in a wider spectral range simultaneously.</strong></p>\n<p>Modalities offered within Euro-BioImaging include single-frequency CARS imaging, combined into multi-mode simultaneous imaging of CARS, SHG and 2P-fluorescence signals.</p>\n<p>CARS has been proven useful in some very specific application fields. The CARS technique is particularly well suited for high-resolution label-free imaging of lipids due to the high concentration of carbon-hydrogen bonds in the lipid material. Lipid imaging has been applied to a great variety of samples including lipid droplets in fixed and live cell cultures, various tissue sections, and even small animals in vivo (e.g. zebrafish). In pharmaceutical applications, CARS microscopy is gaining more and more interest.

By using wideband low coherence light sources, OCT can achieve subcellular spatial resolution as well as high temporal resolution.

Quantitative measurements could help not only for identifying anatomical abnormalities but also for detecting initial loss of function or tissue alteration.</p>\n          <p> <a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/content/use-cases/#volumetric\" target=\"_blank\">Use cases</a></p>\n          <p><strong>Available at:</strong><span></span></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz\" target=\"_blank\">Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi\" target=\"_blank\">Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed - DIMP NEUROMED</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging\" target=\"_blank\">Danish BioImaging (DK)</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/facility-of-excellence-in-imaging---alm-and-molecular-imaging-node-maastricht\" target=\"_blank\">Facility of Multimodal Imaging - AMMI Maastricht (NL)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node\" target=\"_blank\">Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node\" target=\"_blank\">Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary\" target=\"_blank\">Medical and Preclinical Imaging Hungary (HU)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging\" target=\"_blank\">Israel BioImaging (IL)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node\" target=\"_blank\">Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node\" target=\"_blank\">Preclinical Imaging Centre (PRIME) - Molecular Imaging Dutch Node</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure\" target=\"_blank\">NORMOLIM, Norwegian Molecular Imaging Infrastructure</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub\" target=\"_blank\">Dutch High Field Imaging Hub</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary\" target=\"blank\"> Medical and Preclinicial Imaging Hungary</a></li></ul>\n        \n        </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"accordion-item\">\n    <h2 class=\"accordion-header\" id=\"flush-headingTwo\">\n      <button class=\"accordion-button collapsed\" type=\"button\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\" data-bs-target=\"#flush-collapseTwo\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"flush-collapseTwo\">\n          Relaxation mapping - T1, T2, T2*, spin-lock MR techniques\n      </button>\n    </h2>\n    <div id=\"flush-collapseTwo\" class=\"accordion-collapse collapse\" aria-labelledby=\"flush-headingTwo\" data-bs-parent=\"#accordionFlushExample\">\n      <div class=\"accordion-body\">\n          <p>The signal intensity in&nbsp; MR images is&nbsp; a function of water content, tissue properties and of MRI acquisition parameters.</p><p>For quantitative MR imaging, tissue relaxation times are measured by extracting the signal exponential decay (T2 or T2*) or recovery (T1) from multiple measurements.&nbsp; T1, T2 and/or T1rho parametric images can be acquired.</p><p>The quantification of relaxation times provides more detailed information on the tissue characteristics (tumor cells invasion, ischemic lesions, vascular leakage, iron deposition, inflammation etc), thus supporting the clinicians in the diagnostic process.

Phosphate metabolites that are involved in ATP production and utilization can be quantified non-invasively by 31P-MRS/MRI, while 31P magnetization transfer (MT) techniques allow in vivo measurement of metabolic fluxes via creatine kinase (CK) and ATP synthase (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.21037%2Fqims.2017.11.03\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.21037%2Fqims.2017.11.03</a>).</p>\n          <p>For 13C-MRI, hyperpolarized probes are usually used in order to increase the sensitivity of the technique (see Hyperpolarized MRI).</p>\n<p>19F MRI is increasingly emerging as a multi-nuclear (1H/19F) technique that can be exploited for several purposes, e.g. cell tracking, detection of active inflammation, measuring tissue oxygenation and to study fluorinated pharmaceuticals. The lack of a 19F background signal in tissues affords an unequivocal detection suitable for quantification. Fluorine-based contrast agents can be engineered as nanoemulsions, nanocapsules, or nanoparticles to label cells in vitro or in vivo. Multispectral 19F-MRI using different fluorinated compounds could be also used to detect different labeled cells simultaneously. Specific fluorinated products can be used to map pO2 heterogeneity in tissues.

This is particularly true for nuclei other than protons. Hyperpolarized probes are molecules where the nuclei polarization has been artificially raised. Conversely to standard MRI contrast agents, which act on the relaxation of water protons, hyperpolarized molecules are themselves the source of the NMR signal, thus yielding to signal intensity and SNR that linearly depend upon their concentration and polarization level. Long relaxation times of the hyperpolarized nuclei are essential in order to preserve the polarization for as long as possible. For this reason HP-MRI relies on the detection of heteronuclei rather than  protons. For most applications 13C-probes are used.</p><p>\nThe use of hyperpolarized probes allows to obtain very strong signal enhancements, thus overcoming the MR sensitivity issue and making the detection of low concentration biological molecules possible. Hyperpolarized probes are usually employed for perfusion studies and for mapping metabolites and their transformations through MRS in the body. Hyperpolarized metabolic imaging is particularly useful for the early diagnosis of cancer and monitoring of treatments efficacy because it can reveal changes that happen well before the onset of macroscopic signs of the disease. A typical example is the monitoring of pyruvate and lactate levels after injection of hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate.\n</p>\n          <p>Other examples of applications in the preclinical and clinical fields can be found in the following reviews:</p>\n          <ul>\n              <li><p>Z.J.

The image contrast can be controlled by changing the values of specific acquisition parameters, generally the echo time (TE) and the repetition time (TR). Depending on their values, it is possible to obtain images where the contrast and brightness are predominantly determined by the T1 or T2 properties of water in tissues (T1-weighted and T2-weighted images respectively).&nbsp;</p><p>Contrast agents are frequently administered to enhance the contrast for assessment of organ functions (perfusion, vascularity, permeability) or better delineation of specific lesions or tissues. Mainly Gd based molecules are used with the acquisition of T1-weighted images and for specific cases iron Oxides could be used with T2-weighted images.</p><p>The acquisition of anatomical MR images is done with the scope of obtaining detailed morphological information ( shape, size, volume, texture&hellip;) of various body regions or lesions (e.g. tumors, ischemia, cysts etc) and to monitor disease progression or regression.</p><ul><li><p>Kinnunen K.

Of note, new MRI methods are constantly being developed. By using the sensitivity of MRI to these tissue properties, it is possible to generate quantitative maps instead of qualitative anatomical images, where the intensity of each pixel corresponds to a measurement of one specific physical or physiological property.

Phosphate metabolites that are involved in ATP production and utilization can be quantified non-invasively by 31P-MRS/MRI, while 31P magnetization transfer (MT) techniques allow in vivo measurement of metabolic fluxes via creatine kinase (CK) and ATP synthase (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.21037%2Fqims.2017.11.03\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.21037%2Fqims.2017.11.03</a>).</p>\n          <p>For 13C-MRI, hyperpolarized probes are usually used in order to increase the sensitivity of the technique (see Hyperpolarized MRI).</p>\n<p>19F MRI is increasingly emerging as a multi-nuclear (1H/19F) technique that can be exploited for several purposes, e.g. cell tracking, detection of active inflammation, measuring tissue oxygenation and to study fluorinated pharmaceuticals. The lack of a 19F background signal in tissues affords an unequivocal detection suitable for quantification. Fluorine-based contrast agents can be engineered as nanoemulsions, nanocapsules, or nanoparticles to label cells in vitro or in vivo. Multispectral 19F-MRI using different fluorinated compounds could be also used to detect different labeled cells simultaneously. Specific fluorinated products can be used to map pO2 heterogeneity in tissues.

This is particularly true for nuclei other than protons. Hyperpolarized probes are molecules where the nuclei polarization has been artificially raised. Conversely to standard MRI contrast agents, which act on the relaxation of water protons, hyperpolarized molecules are themselves the source of the NMR signal, thus yielding to signal intensity and SNR that linearly depend upon their concentration and polarization level. Long relaxation times of the hyperpolarized nuclei are essential in order to preserve the polarization for as long as possible. For this reason HP-MRI relies on the detection of heteronuclei rather than  protons. For most applications 13C-probes are used.</p><p>\nThe use of hyperpolarized probes allows to obtain very strong signal enhancements, thus overcoming the MR sensitivity issue and making the detection of low concentration biological molecules possible. Hyperpolarized probes are usually employed for perfusion studies and for mapping metabolites and their transformations through MRS in the body. Hyperpolarized metabolic imaging is particularly useful for the early diagnosis of cancer and monitoring of treatments efficacy because it can reveal changes that happen well before the onset of macroscopic signs of the disease. A typical example is the monitoring of pyruvate and lactate levels after injection of hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate.\n</p>\n          <p>Other examples of applications in the preclinical and clinical fields can be found in the following reviews:</p>\n          <ul>\n              <li><p>Z.J.

Briefly, the technique detects endogenous or exogenous chromophores that are excited through an illumination carried out with pulsed laser light, typically in the Red-NIR range. The non-radiative release of the absorbed energy produces a microheating and a thermoelastic expansion in the chromophore close surroundings, which can generate ultrasound. The acoustic waves are detected by a transducer and transformed into an image.</strong></p><p><strong></strong>PAI combines the advantages of optical and US imaging technologies. The detection of the US signal makes it possible to achieve an increase of both spatial resolution (micrometric) and penetration depth with respect to optical imaging and reduces scattering phenomena. Other advantages include good sensitivity (comparable to that of optical imaging), safety, cheapness and ease of use.</p><p>A very large number of chromophores can be used to generate PAI contrast: endogenous molecules (e.g. oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin, myoglobin, melanin), exogenous probes (e.g. organic dyes like fluorescein and ICG), nanosystems (e.g. noble metals-containing nanoparticles, quantum dots, carbon nanotubes, etc.) and also fluorescent proteins and gene reporters. Detection of different types of chromophores in the same anatomical region is also feasible.</p><p>As any tomographic technique, PAI allows to get 3D-high resolution images of soft tissues which provide anatomical, functional, and molecular information. Due to the not optimal penetration depth, PAI is particularly useful for preclinical imaging, whereas in humans it’s use is limited to superficial organs analysis (e.g. palmar vessels detection, breast analysis). The most important in vivo application of PAI is the detection of blood hemoglobin, which provides a different PA signal depending on its deoxy- or oxy-state, allowing it to evaluate the vascular volume and pO2 in normal and hypoxic conditions.</p><p>Other applications in the preclinical biomedical field include, but are not limited to:</p><ul><li><p>oncology (cancer detection, assessment of vascular volume and hypoxia, targeting experiments, assessment of drug distribution and therapy outcome)</p></li><li><p>neurobiology (stroke, brain cancer, intracranial injection of drugs, functional imaging)</p></li><li><p>cardiovascular biology (heart attack, detection of atherosclerotic plaques, hemodynamic and O2 perfusion)</p></li><li><p>in developmental biology (vascular volume and oxygenation of placenta, image-guided embryo injection, fetal analysis)</p></li><li><p>abdomen analysis (kidney diseases as renal microcirculation flow, renal obstruction analysis, gastrointestinal motility, organs’ perfusion)</p></li><li><p>skin analysis (mainly detection of melanin in melanoma cells)</p></li><li><p>image-guided injection of drug</p></li></ul><p><br></p>","category":{"id":"88f6b6cb-b1e0-4b33-b15d-b32c118bac24","name":"Mesoscopic Imaging"}},{"id":"182db29a-bf27-41a7-b4b2-b72d4a28ef3b","name":"Photomanipulation (Pmanip)","abbr":"","description":"Photomanipulation includes a variety of techniques in which lasers (or other light sources) are used to interact with the sample in a targeted fashion.

(QPI)","long_description":"<h2>Quantitative Phase Imaging *</h2><hr>\n<p><strong>Quantitative Phase Imaging (QPI) has emerged as a valuable method for investigating cells and tissues. QPI operates on unlabelled specimens and, as such, is complementary to established fluorescence microscopy, exhibiting lower phototoxicity and no photobleaching. QPI is a label-free technique in which various methods (for example off-axis digital holography, wavefront sensing, spatial light interference, ptychography) are used to retrieve the phase information of light passing through the cell. In contrast to traditional qualitative label-free techniques such as phase contrast or DIC, QPI measures the absolute phase delay and is high-contrast. In 2D acquisitions the images represent quantitative maps of optical path length delays introduced by the specimen, which correspond to differences between refractive index of the cellular components and medium, and the length of the optical path within the cell. The phase delay can be directly converted into a dry mass of the cell. In 3D acquisition a spatial distribution of refractive indices is obtained, giving a three-dimensional shape of the cell and its compartments.</strong></p>\n<p>QPI provides an objective measure of morphology and dynamics, free of variability due to contrast agents not used. QPI data are suitable for image segmentation, making label-free cell counting and tracking easy.</p>\n<p>Application areas:<br>\nThe interpretation of the phase signal has proven to deliver novel parameters for studying physiological processes in living cells, such as transmembrane fluid flux, dry mass and water content changes, intracellular transport as well as tissue structure and density changes. Protein concentrations, growth and cell motility can be precisely quantified. The morphologies of cells and organelles can be established by phase tomography. Their studies provide information on the biomechanical characteristics of cell structures and membranes. These data are indicative of biomolecular activity, which can be affected by pathology.</p>\n\n<br><br>\n","category":{"id":"34fb4c18-d759-423c-a670-d982f3e0955b","name":"Label-free Imaging"}},{"id":"346c0634-5360-47db-a0d8-a89e581d1ea4","name":"Raman Spectroscopy (RS)","abbr":"","description":"raman-spectroscopy-rs","long_description":"<h2></h2><h2>RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY</h2><hr><p><strong>Raman spectroscopy&nbsp;is a&nbsp;spectroscopic&nbsp;technique&nbsp;based on inelastic scattering of monochromatic light, usually from a laser source.

Additionally, the sparsely activated fluorescent molecules must be separated by a distance that exceeds the Abbe diffraction limit (in effect, greater than approximately 250 nanometers) to enable the parallel recording of many individual emitters, each having a distinct set of coordinates in the lateral image  plane. <br><br>\nPhoto activated localization microscopy (PALM) is a widefield fluorescence microscopy imaging methods that allow obtaining images with a resolution beyond the diffraction limit. PALM is based on collecting a large number of images each containing just a few active isolated fluorophores. The imaging sequence allows for the many emission cycles necessary to stochastically activate each fluorophore from a non-emissive state to a bright state, and back to a bleached state. During each cycle, the density of activated molecules is kept low enough that the molecular images of individual fluorophores do not typically overlap.<br><br>\nGround state depletion microscopy followed by individual molecule return (GSDIM or GSD for short) is a super-resolution technique based on single molecule localization. To precisely localize single molecules and create a high-resolution image the ensemble of overlapping fluorophores are temporally \"separated\". This can be achieved by using high power lasers to transfer fluorophores into long-lived \"off states\" – a non-fluorescent molecule state. Single fluorophores return stochastically from the off state and emit bursts of photons, which are recorded. The position of the fluorophore is determined using a software algorithm. Based on this list of coordinates a super-resolution image is reconstructed.\n</strong></p>","category":{"id":"c3ff3572-d01f-4f4f-abf1-ccea9cb12dfd","name":"Fluorescence Nanoscopy"}},{"id":"35a1cf8f-78bb-4ab2-8505-f1d9467130ab","name":"Single Particle Tracking (SPT)*","abbr":"","description":"Single Particle Tracking (SPT)","long_description":null,"category":{"id":"c3ff3572-d01f-4f4f-abf1-ccea9cb12dfd","name":"Fluorescence Nanoscopy"}},{"id":"c2fcc0eb-e1e4-4163-a26a-855f338f56c8","name":"Single molecule FRET (smFRET)*","abbr":"","description":"Single molecule FRET allows the measurement of distances and distance changes between two fluorescent molecules in a biomolecular complexes, down to the Angstrom and the microsecond timescales. smFRET measurement can be performed on diffusing molecules, in a confocal geometry, to measure distances and fast conformational changes or on immobilized molecules to measure association dissociation kinetics and conformational changes in the seconds timescales.","long_description":"<h2>Single molecule FRET * (smFRET)</h2><hr>\n<p><strong>Single molecule FRET allows the measurement of distances and distance changes between two fluorescent molecules in a biomolecular complexes, down to the Angstrom and the microsecond timescales. smFRET measurement can be performed on diffusing molecules, in a confocal geometry, to measure distances and fast conformational changes or on immobilized molecules to measure association dissociation kinetics and conformational changes in the seconds timescales.</strong></p>","category":{"id":"f1991fd9-386e-43ff-b968-81a55df3af19","name":"Functional Imaging and specialised methodologies"}},{"id":"2d65deee-89c0-4a88-9a58-e056660c0a18","name":"Spatial Transcriptomics (ST)*","abbr":"","description":"Spatial Transcriptomics (ST)","long_description":null,"category":{"id":"f1991fd9-386e-43ff-b968-81a55df3af19","name":"Functional Imaging and specialised methodologies"}},{"id":"88287b12-592a-486c-84a4-03cf19f9dd62","name":"Spinning disk confocal microscopy (SDCM)","abbr":"","description":"Spinning disc confocal microscopy is one of the solutions for routine and high-performance fluorescence live-cell imaging applications.

SIM is a camera based widefield fluorescence microscope employing a patterned illumination, e.g. stripes, to excite the fluorescence in the sample. The diffraction limited structured illumination pattern is the key element that allows to extract higher frequencies from the sample and thus achieve the improved spatial resolution. To obtain one super-resolution image, several images with shifted and rotated illumination patterns projected on the sample are acquired. The set of acquired images is then mathematically processed to reconstruct the super-resolution image. The reachable resolution improvement, both laterally and axially, is twice as better as with conventional widefield microscopy for the same wavelength. Data acquisition for one super-resolution SIM image takes from hundreds of milliseconds to seconds.</strong></p>\n<p>SIM is a versatile super-resolution technique used for a detailed imaging of cellular structures within cell monolayers or thin tissue sections. The strength of the method lies in the compatibility with a high number of standard fluorophores allowing relatively simple multi-color imaging, and in live-cell imaging friendliness in terms of acquisition speed and used laser powers (phototoxicity) . The downside of SIM compared to other super-resolution techniques (STED, SMLM) is a moderate resolution improvement and proneness to image artifacts formation.</p>\n<p>There are different realizations of SIM microscopes.

In this case, dedicated image reconstruction algorithms, such as the Feldkamp filtered back projection (FBP) algorithm, are needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Preclinical microCT systems can be stand alone or integrated with other modalities like optical or nuclear medicine imaging in order to perform multimodal imaging.&nbsp; microCT devices can be also found in small animal radiotherapy systems for animal positioning and treatment planning.</p>\n<p><strong>At Euro-BioImaging, preclinical and ex-vivo CT is provided by the following Nodes:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi\" target=\"_blank\">Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)</a></li>\n    \n    <li><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI) (CZ)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed - DIMP NEUROMED</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging\" target=\"_blank\">Danish BioImaging (DK)</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/facility-of-excellence-in-imaging---alm-and-molecular-imaging-node-maastricht\" target=\"_blank\">Facility of Multimodal Imaging - AMMI Maastricht (NL)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node\" target=\"_blank\">Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node\" target=\"_blank\">Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary\" target=\"_blank\">Hungary: Medical and Preclinical Imaging Hungary (HU)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging\" target=\"_blank\">Israel BioImaging (IL)</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node\" target=\"_blank\">Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node\" target=\"_blank\">Preclinical Imaging Centre (PRIME) - Molecular Imaging Dutch Node</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Use cases</h3><p> Click here for \n<a href=\"/content/use-cases/#CT\" target=\"_blank\">Use Cases</a>&nbsp;from our Nodes.</p>\n<div class=\"accordion accordion-flush\" id=\"accordionFlushExample\">\n  <div class=\"accordion-item\">\n    <h2 class=\"accordion-header\" id=\"flush-headingOne\">\n      <button class=\"accordion-button collapsed\" type=\"button\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\" data-bs-target=\"#flush-collapseOne\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"flush-collapseOne\">\n        Dual energy CT\n      </button>\n    </h2>\n    <div id=\"flush-collapseOne\" class=\"accordion-collapse collapse\" aria-labelledby=\"flush-headingOne\" data-bs-parent=\"#accordionFlushExample\">\n      <div class=\"accordion-body\">\n        <p>\n          Dual energy CT (DECT) was firstly introduced in 1976 with the main\n          goal of obtaining the photoelectric and Compton components of the\n          absorption coefficients using a polychromatic x-ray beam with\n          different energies.

Intravital Imaging can be performed using 2-photon microscopy, light-sheet microscopy or others. The choice is usually made based on the required penetration depth and resolution.

These include various analyses of vascular function, following the migration and cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions of e.g. immune cells or invasive/metastatic tumor cells in different tissues, and changes in e.g. neuronal or astrocyte morphology in response to stimulus or injury. Intravital brain imaging is increasingly done in awake rodents, which allows the integration of e.g. sensory cues for analysis of behavioral responses.

More recently,&nbsp; novel classes of contrast agents have been developed, such as hyperpolarized molecules for high sensitivity metabolic studies, or CEST agents for accurate pH parametric imaging.</p><p>Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) can be used to complement MRI in the characterization of tissues. While MRI makes use of water proton signals to create images, MRS uses either proton or heteronuclei signals to determine the relative concentrations of metabolites within a specific organ/tissue.</p><p>MRI scanners at high magnetic fields have the advantage to significantly increase the sensitivity and thus improve the image resolution and scan duration. MRS also benefits from high magnetic fields with an increased spectral resolution, which improves the separation between different chemical components. Nowadays, scanners at 3-7 Tesla are commonly used for both humans and animals, but for small-medium animal studies high field scanners operating at 7-9.4T are also quite common.

Nevertheless, technological progress, development of acquisition methods and the availability of equipment operating at high magnetic fields have made in vivo heteronuclear MRI/MRS possible in both humans and small animals despite sensitivity limitation, widening  the number of applications and the range of metabolites that can be mapped by MRS.</p>\n          <p>Sodium (23Na) MRI has been applied in a large variety of biomedical/clinical research areas. Sodium ions (Na+) play an important role in many cellular physiological processes. An unbalanced concentration gradient across the cell membranes or an increase in the intracellular Na+ content is an early marker of cell viability in many disease processes. 23Na-MRI can be used for studying heart diseases, by exploiting the increase in the extracellular sodium signal in acute ischemia, for cancer investigations, by measuring the increase of sodium content in proliferating cells, and for testing  therapies by evaluating the intracellular sodium accumulation due to cell death <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jacr.2007.07.001\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jacr.2007.07.001</a>).</p>\n          <p>31P MRS can be used to study the energetic metabolism of a wide range of tissues such as muscle, heart, liver, and kidney in various pathological contexts.

Phosphate metabolites that are involved in ATP production and utilization can be quantified non-invasively by 31P-MRS/MRI, while 31P magnetization transfer (MT) techniques allow in vivo measurement of metabolic fluxes via creatine kinase (CK) and ATP synthase (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.21037%2Fqims.2017.11.03\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.21037%2Fqims.2017.11.03</a>).</p>\n          <p>For 13C-MRI, hyperpolarized probes are usually used in order to increase the sensitivity of the technique (see Hyperpolarized MRI).</p>\n<p>19F MRI is increasingly emerging as a multi-nuclear (1H/19F) technique that can be exploited for several purposes, e.g. cell tracking, detection of active inflammation, measuring tissue oxygenation and to study fluorinated pharmaceuticals. The lack of a 19F background signal in tissues affords an unequivocal detection suitable for quantification. Fluorine-based contrast agents can be engineered as nanoemulsions, nanocapsules, or nanoparticles to label cells in vitro or in vivo.

This is particularly true for nuclei other than protons. Hyperpolarized probes are molecules where the nuclei polarization has been artificially raised. Conversely to standard MRI contrast agents, which act on the relaxation of water protons, hyperpolarized molecules are themselves the source of the NMR signal, thus yielding to signal intensity and SNR that linearly depend upon their concentration and polarization level. Long relaxation times of the hyperpolarized nuclei are essential in order to preserve the polarization for as long as possible. For this reason HP-MRI relies on the detection of heteronuclei rather than  protons. For most applications 13C-probes are used.</p><p>\nThe use of hyperpolarized probes allows to obtain very strong signal enhancements, thus overcoming the MR sensitivity issue and making the detection of low concentration biological molecules possible. Hyperpolarized probes are usually employed for perfusion studies and for mapping metabolites and their transformations through MRS in the body. Hyperpolarized metabolic imaging is particularly useful for the early diagnosis of cancer and monitoring of treatments efficacy because it can reveal changes that happen well before the onset of macroscopic signs of the disease. A typical example is the monitoring of pyruvate and lactate levels after injection of hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate.\n</p>\n          <p>Other examples of applications in the preclinical and clinical fields can be found in the following reviews:</p>\n          <ul>\n              <li><p>Z.J.

Phosphate metabolites that are involved in ATP production and utilization can be quantified non-invasively by 31P-MRS/MRI, while 31P magnetization transfer (MT) techniques allow in vivo measurement of metabolic fluxes via creatine kinase (CK) and ATP synthase (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.21037%2Fqims.2017.11.03\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.21037%2Fqims.2017.11.03</a>).</p>\n          <p>For 13C-MRI, hyperpolarized probes are usually used in order to increase the sensitivity of the technique (see Hyperpolarized MRI).</p>\n<p>19F MRI is increasingly emerging as a multi-nuclear (1H/19F) technique that can be exploited for several purposes, e.g. cell tracking, detection of active inflammation, measuring tissue oxygenation and to study fluorinated pharmaceuticals. The lack of a 19F background signal in tissues affords an unequivocal detection suitable for quantification. Fluorine-based contrast agents can be engineered as nanoemulsions, nanocapsules, or nanoparticles to label cells in vitro or in vivo. Multispectral 19F-MRI using different fluorinated compounds could be also used to detect different labeled cells simultaneously. Specific fluorinated products can be used to map pO2 heterogeneity in tissues.

This is particularly true for nuclei other than protons. Hyperpolarized probes are molecules where the nuclei polarization has been artificially raised. Conversely to standard MRI contrast agents, which act on the relaxation of water protons, hyperpolarized molecules are themselves the source of the NMR signal, thus yielding to signal intensity and SNR that linearly depend upon their concentration and polarization level. Long relaxation times of the hyperpolarized nuclei are essential in order to preserve the polarization for as long as possible. For this reason HP-MRI relies on the detection of heteronuclei rather than  protons. For most applications 13C-probes are used.</p><p>\nThe use of hyperpolarized probes allows to obtain very strong signal enhancements, thus overcoming the MR sensitivity issue and making the detection of low concentration biological molecules possible. Hyperpolarized probes are usually employed for perfusion studies and for mapping metabolites and their transformations through MRS in the body. Hyperpolarized metabolic imaging is particularly useful for the early diagnosis of cancer and monitoring of treatments efficacy because it can reveal changes that happen well before the onset of macroscopic signs of the disease. A typical example is the monitoring of pyruvate and lactate levels after injection of hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate.\n</p>\n          <p>Other examples of applications in the preclinical and clinical fields can be found in the following reviews:</p>\n          <ul>\n              <li><p>Z.J.

The image contrast can be controlled by changing the values of specific acquisition parameters, generally the echo time (TE) and the repetition time (TR). Depending on their values, it is possible to obtain images where the contrast and brightness are predominantly determined by the T1 or T2 properties of water in tissues (T1-weighted and T2-weighted images respectively).&nbsp;</p><p>Contrast agents are frequently administered to enhance the contrast for assessment of organ functions (perfusion, vascularity, permeability) or better delineation of specific lesions or tissues. Mainly Gd based molecules are used with the acquisition of T1-weighted images and for specific cases iron Oxides could be used with T2-weighted images.</p><p>The acquisition of anatomical MR images is done with the scope of obtaining detailed morphological information ( shape, size, volume, texture&hellip;) of various body regions or lesions (e.g. tumors, ischemia, cysts etc) and to monitor disease progression or regression.</p><ul><li><p>Kinnunen K.

Of note, new MRI methods are constantly being developed. By using the sensitivity of MRI to these tissue properties, it is possible to generate quantitative maps instead of qualitative anatomical images, where the intensity of each pixel corresponds to a measurement of one specific physical or physiological property.

Phosphate metabolites that are involved in ATP production and utilization can be quantified non-invasively by 31P-MRS/MRI, while 31P magnetization transfer (MT) techniques allow in vivo measurement of metabolic fluxes via creatine kinase (CK) and ATP synthase (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.21037%2Fqims.2017.11.03\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.21037%2Fqims.2017.11.03</a>).</p>\n          <p>For 13C-MRI, hyperpolarized probes are usually used in order to increase the sensitivity of the technique (see Hyperpolarized MRI).</p>\n<p>19F MRI is increasingly emerging as a multi-nuclear (1H/19F) technique that can be exploited for several purposes, e.g. cell tracking, detection of active inflammation, measuring tissue oxygenation and to study fluorinated pharmaceuticals. The lack of a 19F background signal in tissues affords an unequivocal detection suitable for quantification. Fluorine-based contrast agents can be engineered as nanoemulsions, nanocapsules, or nanoparticles to label cells in vitro or in vivo. Multispectral 19F-MRI using different fluorinated compounds could be also used to detect different labeled cells simultaneously. Specific fluorinated products can be used to map pO2 heterogeneity in tissues.

This is particularly true for nuclei other than protons. Hyperpolarized probes are molecules where the nuclei polarization has been artificially raised. Conversely to standard MRI contrast agents, which act on the relaxation of water protons, hyperpolarized molecules are themselves the source of the NMR signal, thus yielding to signal intensity and SNR that linearly depend upon their concentration and polarization level. Long relaxation times of the hyperpolarized nuclei are essential in order to preserve the polarization for as long as possible. For this reason HP-MRI relies on the detection of heteronuclei rather than  protons. For most applications 13C-probes are used.</p><p>\nThe use of hyperpolarized probes allows to obtain very strong signal enhancements, thus overcoming the MR sensitivity issue and making the detection of low concentration biological molecules possible. Hyperpolarized probes are usually employed for perfusion studies and for mapping metabolites and their transformations through MRS in the body. Hyperpolarized metabolic imaging is particularly useful for the early diagnosis of cancer and monitoring of treatments efficacy because it can reveal changes that happen well before the onset of macroscopic signs of the disease. A typical example is the monitoring of pyruvate and lactate levels after injection of hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate.\n</p>\n          <p>Other examples of applications in the preclinical and clinical fields can be found in the following reviews:</p>\n          <ul>\n              <li><p>Z.J.

MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields, radiofrequency pulses, and field gradients to generate images of soft tissues throughout the body.</strong><br></p><p>Contrast agents based on paramagnetic compounds are commonly used to enhance the signal/noise ratio and assess vascularization or tissue permeability. More recently,&nbsp; novel classes of contrast agents have been developed, such as hyperpolarized molecules for high sensitivity metabolic studies, or CEST agents for accurate pH parametric imaging.</p><p>Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) can be used to complement MRI in the characterization of tissues. While MRI makes use of water proton signals to create images, MRS uses either proton or heteronuclei signals to determine the relative concentrations of metabolites within a specific organ/tissue.</p><p>MRI scanners at high magnetic fields have the advantage to significantly increase the sensitivity and thus improve the image resolution and scan duration. MRS also benefits from high magnetic fields with an increased spectral resolution, which improves the separation between different chemical components. Nowadays, scanners at 3-7 Tesla are commonly used for both humans and animals, but for small-medium animal studies high field scanners operating at 7-9.4T are also quite common. Ultra-high field MR systems with fields of up to 17 T are also available mainly for preclinical studies.&nbsp;</p><p>In microMRI/MRS, the instruments are technically optimized for small animal studies, providing resolution in the mm to µm range.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>MRI, either as a single modality or paired to other imaging modalities, is largely used for&nbsp;<em>in vivo</em>&nbsp;(humans and animals) studies and also for ex-vivo analysis of specimens (organs or tissue samples).</p><p>In preclinical imaging, animal models of various pathologies, from tumors to cardiovascular, neurological or metabolic disorders, are commonly used to monitor disease development and to test the&nbsp;efficacy of therapeutic treatments, to develop novel diagnostic tools etc. Several quantitative imaging biomarkers can be used to monitor disease progression over time.&nbsp;</p><p>Animal imaging can also be used for veterinary studies.</p><p>At clinical level, MRI is&nbsp;generally a key tool for the diagnosis of various pathologies and for monitoring the efficacy of new therapies. It is also commonly used in studies involving healthy volunteers to evaluate metabolism or functions.</p><p>MRI comprises a large number of techniques for various applications ranging from simple morphological measurements throughout all organs to the evaluation of complex systems, functions, and processes in living organisms.</p>\n<p><strong>Preclinical and ex-vivo MRI&nbsp;</strong>is provided by the following Nodes:</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz\" target=\"_blank\">Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi\" target=\"_blank\">Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin\" target=\"_blank\">Brain Imaging Network (BIN)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed -

The image contrast can be controlled by changing the values of specific acquisition parameters, generally the echo time (TE) and the repetition time (TR). Depending on their values, it is possible to obtain images where the contrast and brightness are predominantly determined by the T1 or T2 properties of water in tissues (T1-weighted and T2-weighted images respectively).&nbsp;</p><p>Contrast agents are frequently administered to enhance the contrast for assessment of organ functions (perfusion, vascularity, permeability) or better delineation of specific lesions or tissues. Mainly Gd based molecules are used with the acquisition of T1-weighted images and for specific cases iron Oxides could be used with T2-weighted images.</p><p>The acquisition of anatomical MR images is done with the scope of obtaining detailed morphological information ( shape, size, volume, texture&hellip;) of various body regions or lesions (e.g. tumors, ischemia, cysts etc) and to monitor disease progression or regression.</p><ul><li><p>Kinnunen K.

Of note, new MRI methods are constantly being developed. By using the sensitivity of MRI to these tissue properties, it is possible to generate quantitative maps instead of qualitative anatomical images, where the intensity of each pixel corresponds to a measurement of one specific physical or physiological property.

Phosphate metabolites that are involved in ATP production and utilization can be quantified non-invasively by 31P-MRS/MRI, while 31P magnetization transfer (MT) techniques allow in vivo measurement of metabolic fluxes via creatine kinase (CK) and ATP synthase (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.21037%2Fqims.2017.11.03\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.21037%2Fqims.2017.11.03</a>).</p>\n          <p>For 13C-MRI, hyperpolarized probes are usually used in order to increase the sensitivity of the technique (see Hyperpolarized MRI).</p>\n<p>19F MRI is increasingly emerging as a multi-nuclear (1H/19F) technique that can be exploited for several purposes, e.g. cell tracking, detection of active inflammation, measuring tissue oxygenation and to study fluorinated pharmaceuticals. The lack of a 19F background signal in tissues affords an unequivocal detection suitable for quantification. Fluorine-based contrast agents can be engineered as nanoemulsions, nanocapsules, or nanoparticles to label cells in vitro or in vivo. Multispectral 19F-MRI using different fluorinated compounds could be also used to detect different labeled cells simultaneously. Specific fluorinated products can be used to map pO2 heterogeneity in tissues.

This is particularly true for nuclei other than protons. Hyperpolarized probes are molecules where the nuclei polarization has been artificially raised. Conversely to standard MRI contrast agents, which act on the relaxation of water protons, hyperpolarized molecules are themselves the source of the NMR signal, thus yielding to signal intensity and SNR that linearly depend upon their concentration and polarization level. Long relaxation times of the hyperpolarized nuclei are essential in order to preserve the polarization for as long as possible. For this reason HP-MRI relies on the detection of heteronuclei rather than  protons. For most applications 13C-probes are used.</p><p>\nThe use of hyperpolarized probes allows to obtain very strong signal enhancements, thus overcoming the MR sensitivity issue and making the detection of low concentration biological molecules possible. Hyperpolarized probes are usually employed for perfusion studies and for mapping metabolites and their transformations through MRS in the body. Hyperpolarized metabolic imaging is particularly useful for the early diagnosis of cancer and monitoring of treatments efficacy because it can reveal changes that happen well before the onset of macroscopic signs of the disease. A typical example is the monitoring of pyruvate and lactate levels after injection of hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate.\n</p>\n          <p>Other examples of applications in the preclinical and clinical fields can be found in the following reviews:</p>\n          <ul>\n              <li><p>Z.J.

A difference in respect to MRI of other body regions is that cardiac and respiratory motions cause artifacts. Thus, CMR requires synchronous cardiac and respiratory gating or breath-holding techniques. Cardiac synchronization with ECG is often used to “freeze” the hearth during MR acquisition.</p><p>MRI can also be used to record movies of the cardiac cycle that permit the extraction of a good number of dynamic cardiac parameters (cine MRI).</p><p>For more details on CMR techniques and applications see:</p><ul><li><p>W.-Y.I.

This provides the advantage that the fluorescence signal can be collected under optimal conditions.
