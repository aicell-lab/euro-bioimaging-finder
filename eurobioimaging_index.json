The typical value of 500–700nm can be improved to 100–150nm which corresponds to an almost spherical focal spot with 5–7 times less volume than that of standard confocal microscopy. To achieve a full spherical wavefront with a solid angle of 4π two opposing objective lenses are matched coherently, so the two individual wavefronts add up and join forces.**\n\n## AI Generated Documentation\n\n### Overview\n4Pi microscopy is a sophisticated laser scanning fluorescence microscopy technique that enhances axial resolution to approximately 100-150 nanometers, a significant improvement over conventional confocal microscopy, which typically achieves 500-700 nanometers. This technology utilizes two opposing objective lenses to achieve coherent illumination and detection, allowing for high-resolution imaging of biological samples.\n\n### Key Capabilities\nThe unique configuration of 4Pi microscopy involves juxtaposed dual objectives that focus light at a common focal point, facilitating constructive and destructive interference of emitted light. This results in a point-spread function that is about 1.5 times sharper laterally and seven times sharper axially compared to standard confocal systems. The solid angle for illumination and detection approaches 4π steradians, enabling simultaneous excitation and collection of emitted light from all directions. This capability allows for nearly isotropic resolution, crucial for three-dimensional imaging applications.\n\n### Applications\n4Pi microscopy is particularly valuable in biological research, enabling detailed imaging of live cells and dynamic processes within them. Applications include studying the structural plasticity of organelles such as mitochondria and the Golgi apparatus, as well as observing cellular processes like photobleaching recovery. The technique is also beneficial for visualizing microtubule dynamics and other cytoskeletal structures, providing insights into cellular architecture and function at the nanoscale.\n\n### Advantages\nThe primary advantages of 4Pi microscopy include its ability to produce high-resolution, three-dimensional images with minimal photodamage to live specimens. This makes it an essential tool for researchers investigating complex biological systems, as it allows for real-time observation of molecular interactions and cellular dynamics. The integration of multiphoton excitation with high-performance detection systems further enhances its capabilities, making it a powerful method for advanced microscopy in both biological and materials sciences. Overall, 4Pi microscopy represents a significant advancement in the field of super-resolution imaging, offering unique features that differentiate it from other microscopy techniques.\n\n## References\n\n1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4Pi_Microscope\n2. https://zeiss-campus.magnet.fsu.edu/referencelibrary/superresolution/fourpi.html\n3. https://www.microscopyu.com/references/4pi-superresolution-microscopy\n\n**AI Enhancement Confidence Score:** 0.95\n",

It allows for chemically specific imaging of biological materials without use of fluorescent labels. CARS is a three-photon nonlinear optical process where two synchronous and spatially overlapped optical beams are used to probe molecular vibrations in the sample material. The method is based on stimulated Raman scattering which makes CARS imaging much faster than confocal Raman mapping based on spontaneous Raman scattering (at least 100 times faster). Different experimental realizations of CARS microscopy exist. Typical is the visualization of a selected single vibrational frequency, for example the CH2 symmetric stretching mode around 2800 cm-1. Spectral scanning is realized by tuning the excitation wavelength step-by-step. The alternative approach is hyperspectral CARS which is based on broadband excitation and detection of vibrational frequencies in a wider spectral range simultaneously.**\nModalities offered within Euro-BioImaging include single-frequency CARS imaging, combined into multi-mode simultaneous imaging of CARS, SHG and 2P-fluorescence signals.\nCARS has been proven useful in some very specific application fields.

It can resolve the absorbers located in turbid media. Since the contrast is purely based on optical absorption, the imaging depth of PAI goes beyond the optical mean free path. Depending on specific configurations, PAI can be divided into photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) and photoacoustic tomography (PAT).**\n**Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), on the other hand, uses scattering contrast. When light impinges upon layered structures, backscattered light from interfaces in the sample interferes with a reference light beam, forming modulated interferogram, which can in turn lead to the reconstruction of inner structures of biological samples in vivo. By using wideband low coherence light sources, OCT can achieve subcellular spatial resolution as well as high temporal resolution. In addition to structural imaging, an extension of OCT, namely OCT angiography (OCTA), can produce contrast based on speckle or phase variance, which has seen increasing applications in ophthalmology and dermatology.**\n**OCT can be combined with PAM to form the so-called optical coherence photoacoustic microscopy (OC-PAM) system whereas when PAT is combined with OCT, the system is named optical coherence photoacoustic tomography (OC-PAT).**\nOC-PAT is normally used for large field of view imaging.

This multimodal approach allows for comprehensive analysis of biological tissues, providing both morphological and functional information in a non-invasive manner.\n\n**Key Capabilities**  \nOCT operates using near-infrared light, typically in the 800-1300 nm range, achieving axial resolutions of 1-15 micrometers and a penetration depth of several hundred microns. It utilizes interferometric techniques to capture backscattered light, enabling the reconstruction of detailed cross-sectional images of tissue. In contrast, PAT employs pulsed laser light to generate ultrasound waves from tissue absorption, achieving spatial resolutions of 50-100 micrometers and depths of several centimeters. The integration of these two modalities allows OCT/PAT to provide simultaneous imaging of tissue structure and blood flow dynamics, enhancing the diagnostic capabilities significantly.\n\n**Applications**  \nOCT/PAT is particularly valuable in clinical settings such as ophthalmology, where it is used for imaging retinal structures and assessing vascular conditions. Its applications extend to oncology for tumor characterization, allowing differentiation between malignant and benign tissues based on optical and acoustic properties. Additionally, it is utilized in dermatology for skin imaging and in cardiovascular research to study vascular health and pathology.\n\n**Advantages**  \nThe primary advantage of OCT/PAT lies in its ability to deliver complementary information that enhances diagnostic accuracy. While OCT excels in providing detailed structural images, PAT offers insights into tissue composition and function, such as blood oxygenation and flow. This multimodal approach not only improves the understanding of complex biological systems but also facilitates more effective monitoring of disease progression and treatment responses. Furthermore, the non-invasive nature of both techniques reduces patient discomfort and risk, making them suitable for repeated assessments. Overall, OCT/PAT represents a significant advancement in imaging technology, providing a powerful tool for both clinical diagnostics and biomedical research.\n\n## References\n\n1. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7370601/\n2. https://link.springer.com/referencework/10.1007/978-3-319-06419-2\n3. https://link.springer.com/rwe/10.1007/978-3-319-06419-2_53\n4. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554044/\n\n**AI Enhancement Confidence Score:** 0.95\n",

      "description": "Many biological functions depend critically upon fine details of tissue’s molecular architecture that have resisted exploration by existing imaging techniques. Array tomography (AT) encompasses light and electron microscopy modalities that offer unparalleled opportunities to explore 3D cellular architectures of large samples in extremely fine tructural and molecular detail. Fluorescence-AT achieves much higher resolution and molecular multiplexing than most other fluorescence microscopy methods, while electron-AT can capture 3D ultrastructure easily and rapidly compared to traditional serial-section electron microscopy methods. The Correlative mode of Array Tomography (CAT) furthermore offers the unique capacity of merging the molecular discrimination strengths of multichannel fluorescence microscopy with the ultrastructural imaging strengths of electron microscopy and validating single-modality conclusions since each technique provides unique information based on fundamentally different contrast methods. This new technology covers the current state-of-the-art in volume electron microscopy imaging applied to very large and complex biological samples, including neural circuits, organs (e.g., pancreas, kidney, heart), small model organisms and subcellular organelle networks.

This method can be especially useful as a correlative modality in combination with cryo electron microscopy.**\n\n## AI Generated Documentation\n\n**Overview**  \nCryo Fluorescence Microscopy (CryoFM) is a cutting-edge imaging technique that merges fluorescence microscopy with cryogenic sample preparation, allowing for the visualization of biological samples in a near-native state at cryogenic temperatures. This method is particularly advantageous for studying the structural and functional dynamics of biomolecules and cellular components without the artifacts introduced by traditional imaging techniques.\n\n**Key Capabilities**  \nCryoFM employs rapid vitrification to preserve biological samples, preventing ice crystal formation that can distort cellular architecture. It utilizes specialized fluorophores that maintain their fluorescence properties at low temperatures, enabling high-resolution imaging. The technique can achieve spatial resolutions below 200 nm through the application of super-resolution methods, significantly enhancing the detail visible in biological structures. Additionally, CryoFM can be integrated with other imaging modalities, such as electron microscopy, to provide complementary data about the same sample.\n\n**Applications**  \nCryoFM is widely used in structural biology for the visualization of protein complexes, cellular organelles, and other biomolecular assemblies in their functional states. It is instrumental in various research fields, including cell biology, biochemistry, and materials science. Researchers utilize CryoFM to investigate dynamic processes within cells, such as protein interactions, cellular signaling pathways, and the organization of cellular structures. This technique is also valuable in drug discovery, where understanding molecular interactions at the cellular level is crucial for developing effective therapeutics.\n\n**Advantages**  \nThe primary advantages of CryoFM include:  \n- **Near-native imaging**: Samples are preserved in a state that closely resembles their natural environment, leading to more accurate structural information.  \n- **High resolution**: The combination of fluorescence labeling and cryogenic techniques allows for detailed visualization of biological structures, surpassing the capabilities of conventional fluorescence microscopy.  \n- **Fluorophore stability**: The behavior of fluorophores at low temperatures can enhance signal-to-noise ratios, improving image quality.  \n- **Integration with other techniques**: CryoFM can be combined with electron microscopy for correlative studies, providing a comprehensive view of sample morphology and molecular interactions.  \nIn summary, Cryo Fluorescence Microscopy represents a significant advancement in imaging technology, enabling researchers to explore the complexities of biological systems with unprecedented detail and accuracy.\n\n## References\n\n1. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367593114000623\n2. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4094034/\n\n**AI Enhancement Confidence Score:** 0.95\n",

      "documentation": "## Fourier Transform Infrared Imaging (FTIR)\n---\n**Fourier transform infrared imaging (FTIR) is a technique which is used to obtain an infrared spectrum of absorption, emission, photoconductivity or Raman scattering of a solid, liquid or gas. An FTIR spectrometer simultaneously collects spectral data in a wide spectral range**.\n\n## AI Generated Documentation\n\n### Overview\nFourier Transform Infrared Imaging (FTIR) is a sophisticated spectroscopic technique that enables the analysis of molecular compositions in various states—solids, liquids, and gases—by measuring the absorption of infrared radiation. FTIR provides a unique spectral fingerprint for each material, allowing for precise identification and characterization based on molecular vibrations.\n\n### Key Capabilities\nFTIR operates primarily in the mid-infrared range (4000 to 400 cm⁻¹), where most organic compounds exhibit characteristic absorption peaks. The technology employs an interferometer to collect data across all infrared frequencies simultaneously, which is a significant advancement over traditional dispersive methods that scan wavelengths sequentially. This capability allows for rapid acquisition of spectra, often within seconds. The resolution of FTIR can reach down to 1 cm⁻¹, enabling detailed analysis of complex mixtures. Additionally, FTIR can be coupled with microscopy techniques (FTIR microscopy) to analyze small sample areas, providing spatially resolved chemical information.\n\n### Applications\nFTIR is widely used across multiple fields:\n- **Material Science**: Identification and characterization of polymers, rubbers, and composites, including deformulation studies through TGA-IR and GC-IR techniques.\n- **Pharmaceuticals**: Quality control and assurance, confirming the identity of raw materials and finished products.\n- **Environmental Monitoring**: Analysis of emissions from vehicles and industrial processes, aiding in compliance with environmental regulations.\n- **Cultural Heritage**: Non-destructive analysis of artworks and historical artifacts, facilitating preservation efforts and material composition studies.\n\n### Advantages\nThe advantages of FTIR imaging include:\n- **Speed**: The ability to acquire spectra rapidly makes FTIR ideal for high-throughput screening applications.\n- **Sensitivity**: High sensitivity allows for the detection of trace amounts of substances, which is crucial for advanced research applications.\n- **Non-destructive Testing**: The non-invasive nature of FTIR is particularly beneficial in contexts where sample integrity must be preserved, such as in art conservation.\n- **Quantitative Analysis**: With the integration of modern software algorithms, FTIR can provide quantitative data regarding the concentration of materials, enhancing its utility in analytical chemistry.\n\nIn summary, FTIR imaging stands out for its rapid, sensitive, and versatile capabilities, making it an essential tool for researchers and professionals in various scientific and industrial domains.\n\n## References\n\n1. https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/industrial/spectroscopy-elemental-isotope-analysis/molecular-spectroscopy/fourier-transform-infrared-spectroscopy/applications.html\n2. https://scienceinfo.com/ftir-principle-instrumentation-applications/\n\n**AI Enhancement Confidence Score:** 0.95\n",

This is achieved by replacing the point detector of a classical confocal with an array detector. Each pixel of the array detector records its own scan image when the sample is scanned with the laser spot and the individual images are then combined into a single image. The final ISM image corresponds theoretically to an image with a confocal taken with an entirely closed pinhole, which results in the increased resolution observed. ISM has the potential to nearly double the resolution of a confocal imaging system. Multiple commercial implementations of Image Scanning Microscopy exist both on laser scanning confocals as well as spinning disk systems, such as AiryScan, rescan confocal microscope and SoRa. Non-commercial ISM solutions are also available and in general ISM can be applied to 2-photon imaging and many other light microscopy modalities. Please contact the Node offering the technology to find out more about the specific implementation offered.**\n\n## AI Generated Documentation\n\n**Overview**  \nImage Scanning Microscopy (ISM) is a cutting-edge optical imaging technique that significantly enhances the spatial resolution of conventional confocal microscopy, achieving nearly double the resolution. This method addresses the inherent limitations of traditional confocal systems, particularly the trade-off between resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. By utilizing a fast detector array instead of a single-element detector and confocal pinhole, ISM captures a complete image for each position of the scanned laser beam, resulting in high-resolution imaging of biological samples.  \n\n**Key Capabilities**  \nISM employs a focused laser beam that scans across the sample while detecting emitted fluorescence using a Single Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) array. This configuration allows for rapid and sensitive detection of fluorescence signals, which is essential for imaging samples with low light emission. The effective spatial resolution of ISM is theoretically limited by the excitation wavelength and the numerical aperture of the microscope's objective, following Abbe's formula. Additionally, ISM can be integrated with time-resolved techniques such as Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIM), enabling researchers to obtain dynamic information about molecular interactions within the sample.  \n\n**Applications**  \nThis technique is particularly useful in live-cell imaging, where it minimizes photodamage and photobleaching, allowing for prolonged observation of cellular processes. ISM is also applicable in various fields, including developmental biology, neuroscience, and materials science, where high-resolution imaging of complex structures is required. Its ability to provide detailed insights into molecular dynamics makes it a valuable tool for studying cellular mechanisms and interactions.  \n\n**Advantages**  \nOne of the standout features of ISM is its gentleness on samples, which reduces the risk of photodamage compared to other super-resolution techniques like STED and SIM. This characteristic is crucial for long-term imaging studies. Furthermore, ISM's design allows for straightforward upgrades to existing confocal microscopy systems, enhancing their capabilities without extensive modifications. The access to raw scanned images also facilitates advanced image processing and adaptive reconstruction methods, further improving the quality of the analysis. Overall, ISM represents a significant advancement in microscopy technology, offering enhanced resolution, versatility, and minimal sample disruption, making it an essential tool for modern scientific research.\n\n## References\n\n1. https://www.genoainstruments.com/technology.html\n2. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0291-9\n3. https://vicidominilab.github.io/teaching/teaching-2\n4. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367593119300456\n\n**AI Enhancement Confidence Score:** 0.95\n",

      "documentation": "## Lattice Light-sheet (LLS)\n---\n**Lattice Light Sheet Microscopy (LLS) is a special lightsheet microscope where the excitation plane is very thin (<1 µm) and uniformly flat over typical cellular dimensions (10–100 µm2). TThese illumination planes are created by special light beams called non-diffractive beams or Bessel beams, Airy, or 2D optical lattices. The main advantages of LLSM are its intrinsic optical sectioning, fast imaging (up to 300 frames per second), low photobleaching and phototoxicity, and sub-micrometer spatial resolution over long light sheets (10–100 µm). The typical spatial resolution of LLSM is 270 nm laterally and 550 nm axially (measured at 488 nm excitation, mask: NAin–NAout = 0.44–0.55). The temporal resolution is currently limited by the rate of data transfer to the computer hard disc.**\n\n## AI Generated Documentation\n\n### Overview\nLattice light-sheet microscopy (LLS) is a cutting-edge imaging technique that enables high-resolution, three-dimensional visualization of live biological samples with minimal phototoxicity. Developed by Eric Betzig and his team in the early 2010s, LLS integrates principles from light sheet fluorescence microscopy and Bessel beam technology to provide unprecedented insights into dynamic cellular processes.\n\n### Key Capabilities\nLLS utilizes a structured light sheet generated by a linear array of coherent Bessel-Gauss beams, producing an ultra-thin light sheet that is tightly confined in the axial (Z) direction. This configuration allows for isotropic 3D resolution, which is crucial for accurately capturing cellular structures and processes. The system supports high-speed imaging, capable of capturing images at sub-second intervals over extended periods, facilitating 4D live-cell imaging.

      "documentation": "## Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\n---\n**Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non invasive imaging technique used to obtain 2D/3D \"in vivo\" images representing anatomy and physiological processes (e.g. dynamic perfusion or dynamic changes in blood oxygenation for functional brain mapping, metabolism etc), with high spatial and temporal resolution. MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields, radiofrequency pulses, and field gradients to generate images of soft tissues throughout the body.**\nContrast agents based on paramagnetic compounds are commonly used to enhance the signal/noise ratio and assess vascularization or tissue permeability. More recently,  novel classes of contrast agents have been developed, such as hyperpolarized molecules for high sensitivity metabolic studies, or CEST agents for accurate pH parametric imaging.\nMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) can be used to complement MRI in the characterization of tissues. While MRI makes use of water proton signals to create images, MRS uses either proton or heteronuclei signals to determine the relative concentrations of metabolites within a specific organ/tissue.\nMRI scanners at high magnetic fields have the advantage to significantly increase the sensitivity and thus improve the image resolution and scan duration. MRS also benefits from high magnetic fields with an increased spectral resolution, which improves the separation between different chemical components. Nowadays, scanners at 3-7 Tesla are commonly used for both humans and animals, but for small-medium animal studies high field scanners operating at 7-9.4T are also quite common. Ultra-high field MR systems with fields of up to 17 T are also available mainly for preclinical studies.\nIn microMRI/MRS, the instruments are technically optimized for small animal studies, providing resolution in the mm to µm range.\nMRI, either as a single modality or paired to other imaging modalities, is largely used for *in vivo* (humans and animals) studies and also for ex-vivo analysis of specimens (organs or tissue samples).\nIn preclinical imaging, animal models of various pathologies, from tumors to cardiovascular, neurological or metabolic disorders, are commonly used to monitor disease development and to test the efficacy of therapeutic treatments, to develop novel diagnostic tools etc. Several quantitative imaging biomarkers can be used to monitor disease progression over time.\nAnimal imaging can also be used for veterinary studies.\nAt clinical level, MRI is generally a key tool for the diagnosis of various pathologies and for monitoring the efficacy of new therapies. It is also commonly used in studies involving healthy volunteers to evaluate metabolism or functions.\nMRI comprises a large number of techniques for various applications ranging from simple morphological measurements throughout all organs to the evaluation of complex systems, functions, and processes in living organisms.\n**Preclinical and ex-vivo MRI**is provided by the following Nodes:\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed - DIMP NEUROMED](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Facility of Multimodal Imaging - AMMI Maastricht (NL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/facility-of-excellence-in-imaging---alm-and-molecular-imaging-node-maastricht)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Medical and Preclinical Imaging Hungary (HU)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Population Imaging Node Valencia (ES)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/population-imaging-valencia)\n* [Preclinical Imaging Centre (PRIME) - Molecular Imaging Dutch Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node)\n* [NORMOLIM, Norwegian Molecular Imaging Infrastructure](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)\n**Human MRI** is provided by the following Nodes:\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Population Imaging Node Valencia (ES)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/population-imaging-valencia)\n### Use cases\nClick here for\n[Use Cases](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/preclinical-and-medical-imaging-technologies-use-cases-from-our-nodes/) from our Nodes.\n## Anatomical, volumetric, morphometric MRI\nContrast in MRI images is generated by the differences in the nuclear relaxation times of water protons (T1 and T2) across tissues. The image contrast can be controlled by changing the values of specific acquisition parameters, generally the echo time (TE) and the repetition time (TR). Depending on their values, it is possible to obtain images where the contrast and brightness are predominantly determined by the T1 or T2 properties of water in tissues (T1-weighted and T2-weighted images respectively).\nContrast agents are frequently administered to enhance the contrast for assessment of organ functions (perfusion, vascularity, permeability) or better delineation of specific lesions or tissues. Mainly Gd based molecules are used with the acquisition of T1-weighted images and for specific cases iron Oxides could be used with T2-weighted images.\nThe acquisition of anatomical MR images is done with the scope of obtaining detailed morphological information ( shape, size, volume, texture…) of various body regions or lesions (e.g. tumors, ischemia, cysts etc) and to monitor disease progression or regression.\n* Kinnunen K. M., et al. \"Volumetric MRI-Based Biomarkers in Huntington's Disease: An Evidentiary Review\", <https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.712555>\n* McCarthy J., et al. \"Morphometric MRI as a diagnostic biomarker of frontotemporal dementia: A systematic review to determine clinical applicability\", <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2018.08.028>\nWhile MR images are typically assessed in a qualitative way, MRI can collect quantitative information about tissue properties. The range of properties includes the magnetic resonance (MR) relaxation times T1 and T2, T2\\*, diffusion, perfusion, fat and water fractions, iron fraction, elastic properties of tissue, temperature, chemical composition, and chemical exchange, just to mention some. Of note, new MRI methods are constantly being developed. By using the sensitivity of MRI to these tissue properties, it is possible to generate quantitative maps instead of qualitative anatomical images, where the intensity of each pixel corresponds to a measurement of one specific physical or physiological property. Quantitative measurements could help not only for identifying anatomical abnormalities but also for detecting initial loss of function or tissue alteration.\n[Use cases](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/content/use-cases/#volumetric)\n**Available at:**\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed - DIMP NEUROMED](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Facility of Multimodal Imaging - AMMI Maastricht (NL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/facility-of-excellence-in-imaging---alm-and-molecular-imaging-node-maastricht)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Medical and Preclinical Imaging Hungary (HU)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Preclinical Imaging Centre (PRIME) - Molecular Imaging Dutch Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node)\n* [NORMOLIM, Norwegian Molecular Imaging Infrastructure](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Medical and Preclinicial Imaging Hungary](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n## Relaxation mapping - T1, T2, T2\\*, spin-lock MR techniques\nThe signal intensity in  MR images is  a function of water content, tissue properties and of MRI acquisition parameters.\nFor quantitative MR imaging, tissue relaxation times are measured by extracting the signal exponential decay (T2 or T2\\*) or recovery (T1) from multiple measurements.  T1, T2 and/or T1rho parametric images can be acquired.\nThe quantification of relaxation times provides more detailed information on the tissue characteristics (tumor cells invasion, ischemic lesions, vascular leakage, iron deposition, inflammation etc), thus supporting the clinicians in the diagnostic process. Furthermore, relaxation maps are used to quantitatively assess the presence of exogenous contrast agents.\nExample applications:\n* Evaluation of the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix in cartilage (T.J.

Diffusion imaging is used to obtain important information about water movements within the architecture of tissues. This is achieved by using MRI sequences specifically designed to  measure the values of the water diffusion coefficient (Diffusion Weighted Imaging) and its components along the 3D space (Diffusion Tensor imaging).\nNeither contrast agents nor specific instrumentation are requested for this kind of experiments.\nDiffusion MRI is used to evaluate the molecular function and micro-architecture of tissues, and it acts as a tool for monitoring treatment response and disease progression for a variety of pathologies such as tumors, white matter diseases, inflammatory diseases and so on.

In the first case, dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC)-MRI, which measures the signal loss in T2- or T2\\*-weighted images, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI, which measures the signal loss in T1-weighted images, are used. In the latter case, arterial spin-labeling (ASL) is used.\nWhile ASL is mainly applied for the measurement of cerebral perfusion, DSC and DCE-MRI are used in a wider variety of clinical applications, including the classification of tumors, stroke regions, and characterization of other diseases, as well as for assessing response to antiangiogenic therapies.\n* Boxerman J.L., et al. \"Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast MR Imaging in Glioma: Review of Current Clinical Practice.\" <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2016.06.005>\n* Sujlana, et al. \"Review of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI: Technical aspects and applications in the musculoskeletal system\", <https://doi.org/10.1002/jmri.25810>\nIn neurology, brain perfusion parameters such as Normalized Cerebral Blood Flow (NCBF) and Cerebral Blood Volume (CBV) are relevant hemodynamic parameters, as their changes can precede abnormalities on conventional MR imaging. Thus, knowledge of whether a lesion identified in anatomic images is associated with increased or decreased CBF or CBV can frequently help narrow the differential diagnosis.\n![](upload/asl-mrileft.png)\n![](upload/asl-mriright.png)\nMR images (A) and parameter maps calculated from data of both dynamic susceptibility-contrast MRI (B), and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (C), obtained from a patient with anaplastic astrocytoma in the frontal lobe of the brain.

It is typically based on dynamic measurement of brain with BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent) contrast which is achievable with T2\\* weighted images (e.g. GRE EPI). Other contrast principles can be used as well (e.g. blood perfusion). Typical spatial resolution ranges from 3 x 3 x 3 mm to 2 x 2 x 2 mm in whole brain coverage, or even up to 0.1 mm in limited field of view and at ultra-high fields (7T or more). Temporal resolution ranges from 3 s to 0.5 s with EPI sequence.\nfMRI can be used in medical research (and diagnostics) as well as psychology, neuroeconomy, and other disciplines related to understanding human brain and behavior. It is typically used to measure neural activity during tasks or following to stimuli (e.g. scenario with auditory, visual or tactile stimuli distributed during the acquisition time to induce required brain activity), but resting-state fMRI is possible too. It allows to obtain activation maps, evaluate the hemodynamic response in selected regions, estimate the functional connection among brain regions, and evaluate the relationship between activity/connectivity and external variables.\nfMRI can be combined with electrophysiological recordings or stimulation.\nA special case is fMRI hyperscanning (dual fMRI) with two participants measured simultaneously in two scanners.\nExample applications include:\n* localization of brain functions and networks\n* monitoring brain changes caused by stress\n* discovering brain changes in various diseases (e.g. Alzheimer disease, Schizophrenia etc)\n* understanding empathy, emotions and consciousness\n* understanding the learning process\n* observing brain plasticity, development, aging affects\n**Available at:**\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Medical and Preclinicial Imaging Hungary](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n## Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST), Magnetization Transfer (MT) MRI\nIn CEST imaging, a radiofrequency pulse is applied at the resonant frequency(ies) of exchangeable protons in a given molecule or metabolite, in order to reach a saturation state. Chemical exchange of the protons with those of water molecules causes the transfer of magnetic saturation to water over time. The subsequent decrease in water signal is detected by standard MR imaging sequences and provides an indirect measure of the concentration of the species of interest.\nCEST MRI can detect a variety of endogenous small molecules (e.g. glucose, glycogen, lactate, creatine, glutamate), proteins and enzymes for molecular imaging. Development of exogenous CEST agents, including diamagnetic CEST (DIACEST), paramagnetic CEST (PARACEST) and liposome-based (LIPOCEST) agents, greatly enhanced the sensitivity and specificity of CEST imaging (Longo D.L. et al.; “A snapshot of the vast array of diamagnetic CEST MRI contrast agents” <https://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.4715>; Ferrauto G. et al.; “LipoCEST and cellCEST imaging agents: opportunities and challenges” <https://doi.org/10.1002/wnan.1385>).\nCEST imaging can provide information on tissue pH, temperature, oxygenation, metabolism, enzymatic reactions as well as for molecular imaging applications. Example applications include several disorders such as acute stroke, renal injury, tumors and multiple sclerosis.\n![](upload/chemicalmri.png)\nApplication of MRI-CEST tumor pH imaging for assessing response to novel anticancer therapies.

From [https://doi.org/10.3892/ijo.20...](https://doi.org/10.3892/ijo.2017.4029)\nMagnetization transfer (MT) is based on the observation of the immobile (restricted) hydrogen pool (protons bound to large macromolecular proteins and lipids, such as those found in such cellular membranes as myelin) throughout saturation of this restricted pool and detection on the mobile proton pool. The MT contrast is different from T1, T2, and PD, and it likely reflects the structural integrity of the tissue being imaged. Applications include tissue characterization, such as evaluation of multiple sclerosis and other white-matter lesions and in tumors.\nSee also: van Zijl PCM et al.; “Magnetization Transfer Contrast and Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer MRI.

Since the molecular concentrations of these metabolites are at least 10.000 times lower than water, they produce correspondingly much lower signal strengths. Thus, to detect enough signal above noise for quantification, 1H-MRSI must use much larger voxel sizes in comparison to MRI, leading to lower spatial resolution with respect to anatomical imaging. The use of high magnetic fields allows to overcome this issue.\nMRSI is used in the clinics for quantifying metabolic abnormalities in the human brain, prostate, breast and other organs.\nSee for example:\n* T.A.A. Boroeders et al., “Glutamate levels across deep brain structures in patients with a psychotic disorder and its relation with cognitive functioning”, [http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2021...](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.01.21250977)\n* A.A.

Nevertheless, technological progress, development of acquisition methods and the availability of equipment operating at high magnetic fields have made in vivo heteronuclear MRI/MRS possible in both humans and small animals despite sensitivity limitation, widening the number of applications and the range of metabolites that can be mapped by MRS.\nSodium (23Na) MRI has been applied in a large variety of biomedical/clinical research areas. Sodium ions (Na+) play an important role in many cellular physiological processes. An unbalanced concentration gradient across the cell membranes or an increase in the intracellular Na+ content is an early marker of cell viability in many disease processes. 23Na-MRI can be used for studying heart diseases, by exploiting the increase in the extracellular sodium signal in acute ischemia, for cancer investigations, by measuring the increase of sodium content in proliferating cells, and for testing therapies by evaluating the intracellular sodium accumulation due to cell death <https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jacr.2007.07.001>).\n31P MRS can be used to study the energetic metabolism of a wide range of tissues such as muscle, heart, liver, and kidney in various pathological contexts. Using the endogenous 31P signal arising from the tissue, it is possible to obtain information about the energy status and also determine the intracellular pH (from the chemical shift of Pi). 31P signals from inorganic phosphate, adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, creatine phosphate and sugar phosphates can be observed in whole-cell preparations, intact tissues or organs. Phosphate metabolites that are involved in ATP production and utilization can be quantified non-invasively by 31P-MRS/MRI, while 31P magnetization transfer (MT) techniques allow in vivo measurement of metabolic fluxes via creatine kinase (CK) and ATP synthase (<https://doi.org/10.21037%2Fqims.2017.11.03>).\nFor 13C-MRI, hyperpolarized probes are usually used in order to increase the sensitivity of the technique (see Hyperpolarized MRI).\n19F MRI is increasingly emerging as a multi-nuclear (1H/19F) technique that can be exploited for several purposes, e.g. cell tracking, detection of active inflammation, measuring tissue oxygenation and to study fluorinated pharmaceuticals. The lack of a 19F background signal in tissues affords an unequivocal detection suitable for quantification. Fluorine-based contrast agents can be engineered as nanoemulsions, nanocapsules, or nanoparticles to label cells in vitro or in vivo. Multispectral 19F-MRI using different fluorinated compounds could be also used to detect different labeled cells simultaneously. Specific fluorinated products can be used to map pO2 heterogeneity in tissues.

This is particularly true for nuclei other than protons. Hyperpolarized probes are molecules where the nuclei polarization has been artificially raised. Conversely to standard MRI contrast agents, which act on the relaxation of water protons, hyperpolarized molecules are themselves the source of the NMR signal, thus yielding to signal intensity and SNR that linearly depend upon their concentration and polarization level. Long relaxation times of the hyperpolarized nuclei are essential in order to preserve the polarization for as long as possible. For this reason HP-MRI relies on the detection of heteronuclei rather than protons. For most applications 13C-probes are used.\nThe use of hyperpolarized probes allows to obtain very strong signal enhancements, thus overcoming the MR sensitivity issue and making the detection of low concentration biological molecules possible. Hyperpolarized probes are usually employed for perfusion studies and for mapping metabolites and their transformations through MRS in the body. Hyperpolarized metabolic imaging is particularly useful for the early diagnosis of cancer and monitoring of treatments efficacy because it can reveal changes that happen well before the onset of macroscopic signs of the disease. A typical example is the monitoring of pyruvate and lactate levels after injection of hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate.\nOther examples of applications in the preclinical and clinical fields can be found in the following reviews:\n* Z.J.

A difference in respect to MRI of other body regions is that cardiac and respiratory motions cause artifacts. Thus, CMR requires synchronous cardiac and respiratory gating or breath-holding techniques. Cardiac synchronization with ECG is often used to “freeze” the hearth during MR acquisition.\nMRI can also be used to record movies of the cardiac cycle that permit the extraction of a good number of dynamic cardiac parameters (cine MRI).\nFor more details on CMR techniques and applications see:\n* W.-Y.I.

MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields, radiofrequency pulses, and field gradients to generate images of soft tissues throughout the body.**\nContrast agents based on paramagnetic compounds are commonly used to enhance the signal/noise ratio and assess vascularization or tissue permeability. More recently,  novel classes of contrast agents have been developed, such as hyperpolarized molecules for high sensitivity metabolic studies, or CEST agents for accurate pH parametric imaging.\nMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) can be used to complement MRI in the characterization of tissues. While MRI makes use of water proton signals to create images, MRS uses either proton or heteronuclei signals to determine the relative concentrations of metabolites within a specific organ/tissue.\nMRI scanners at high magnetic fields have the advantage to significantly increase the sensitivity and thus improve the image resolution and scan duration. MRS also benefits from high magnetic fields with an increased spectral resolution, which improves the separation between different chemical components. Nowadays, scanners at 3-7 Tesla are commonly used for both humans and animals, but for small-medium animal studies high field scanners operating at 7-9.4T are also quite common. Ultra-high field MR systems with fields of up to 17 T are also available mainly for preclinical studies.\nIn microMRI/MRS, the instruments are technically optimized for small animal studies, providing resolution in the mm to µm range.\nMRI, either as a single modality or paired to other imaging modalities, is largely used for *in vivo* (humans and animals) studies and also for ex-vivo analysis of specimens (organs or tissue samples).\nIn preclinical imaging, animal models of various pathologies, from tumors to cardiovascular, neurological or metabolic disorders, are commonly used to monitor disease development and to test the efficacy of therapeutic treatments, to develop novel diagnostic tools etc. Several quantitative imaging biomarkers can be used to monitor disease progression over time.\nAnimal imaging can also be used for veterinary studies.\nAt clinical level, MRI is generally a key tool for the diagnosis of various pathologies and for monitoring the efficacy of new therapies. It is also commonly used in studies involving healthy volunteers to evaluate metabolism or functions.\nMRI comprises a large number of techniques for various applications ranging from simple morphological measurements throughout all organs to the evaluation of complex systems, functions, and processes in living organisms.\n**Preclinical and ex-vivo MRI**is provided by the following Nodes:\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed - DIMP NEUROMED](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Facility of Multimodal Imaging - AMMI Maastricht (NL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/facility-of-excellence-in-imaging---alm-and-molecular-imaging-node-maastricht)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Medical and Preclinical Imaging Hungary (HU)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Population Imaging Node Valencia (ES)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/population-imaging-valencia)\n* [Preclinical Imaging Centre (PRIME) - Molecular Imaging Dutch Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node)\n* [NORMOLIM, Norwegian Molecular Imaging Infrastructure](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)\n**Human MRI** is provided by the following Nodes:\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Population Imaging Node Valencia (ES)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/population-imaging-valencia)\n### Use cases\nClick here for\n[Use Cases](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/preclinical-and-medical-imaging-technologies-use-cases-from-our-nodes/) from our Nodes.\n## Anatomical, volumetric, morphometric MRI\nContrast in MRI images is generated by the differences in the nuclear relaxation times of water protons (T1 and T2) across tissues. The image contrast can be controlled by changing the values of specific acquisition parameters, generally the echo time (TE) and the repetition time (TR). Depending on their values, it is possible to obtain images where the contrast and brightness are predominantly determined by the T1 or T2 properties of water in tissues (T1-weighted and T2-weighted images respectively).\nContrast agents are frequently administered to enhance the contrast for assessment of organ functions (perfusion, vascularity, permeability) or better delineation of specific lesions or tissues. Mainly Gd based molecules are used with the acquisition of T1-weighted images and for specific cases iron Oxides could be used with T2-weighted images.\nThe acquisition of anatomical MR images is done with the scope of obtaining detailed morphological information ( shape, size, volume, texture…) of various body regions or lesions (e.g. tumors, ischemia, cysts etc) and to monitor disease progression or regression.\n* Kinnunen K. M., et al. \"Volumetric MRI-Based Biomarkers in Huntington's Disease: An Evidentiary Review\", <https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.712555>\n* McCarthy J., et al. \"Morphometric MRI as a diagnostic biomarker of frontotemporal dementia: A systematic review to determine clinical applicability\", <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2018.08.028>\nWhile MR images are typically assessed in a qualitative way, MRI can collect quantitative information about tissue properties. The range of properties includes the magnetic resonance (MR) relaxation times T1 and T2, T2\\*, diffusion, perfusion, fat and water fractions, iron fraction, elastic properties of tissue, temperature, chemical composition, and chemical exchange, just to mention some. Of note, new MRI methods are constantly being developed. By using the sensitivity of MRI to these tissue properties, it is possible to generate quantitative maps instead of qualitative anatomical images, where the intensity of each pixel corresponds to a measurement of one specific physical or physiological property. Quantitative measurements could help not only for identifying anatomical abnormalities but also for detecting initial loss of function or tissue alteration.\n[Use cases](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/content/use-cases/#volumetric)\n**Available at:**\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed - DIMP NEUROMED](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Facility of Multimodal Imaging - AMMI Maastricht (NL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/facility-of-excellence-in-imaging---alm-and-molecular-imaging-node-maastricht)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Medical and Preclinical Imaging Hungary (HU)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Preclinical Imaging Centre (PRIME) - Molecular Imaging Dutch Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node)\n* [NORMOLIM, Norwegian Molecular Imaging Infrastructure](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Medical and Preclinicial Imaging Hungary](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n## Relaxation mapping - T1, T2, T2\\*, spin-lock MR techniques\nThe signal intensity in  MR images is  a function of water content, tissue properties and of MRI acquisition parameters.\nFor quantitative MR imaging, tissue relaxation times are measured by extracting the signal exponential decay (T2 or T2\\*) or recovery (T1) from multiple measurements.  T1, T2 and/or T1rho parametric images can be acquired.\nThe quantification of relaxation times provides more detailed information on the tissue characteristics (tumor cells invasion, ischemic lesions, vascular leakage, iron deposition, inflammation etc), thus supporting the clinicians in the diagnostic process.

Diffusion imaging is used to obtain important information about water movements within the architecture of tissues. This is achieved by using MRI sequences specifically designed to  measure the values of the water diffusion coefficient (Diffusion Weighted Imaging) and its components along the 3D space (Diffusion Tensor imaging).\nNeither contrast agents nor specific instrumentation are requested for this kind of experiments.\nDiffusion MRI is used to evaluate the molecular function and micro-architecture of tissues, and it acts as a tool for monitoring treatment response and disease progression for a variety of pathologies such as tumors, white matter diseases, inflammatory diseases and so on.

In the first case, dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC)-MRI, which measures the signal loss in T2- or T2\\*-weighted images, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI, which measures the signal loss in T1-weighted images, are used. In the latter case, arterial spin-labeling (ASL) is used.\nWhile ASL is mainly applied for the measurement of cerebral perfusion, DSC and DCE-MRI are used in a wider variety of clinical applications, including the classification of tumors, stroke regions, and characterization of other diseases, as well as for assessing response to antiangiogenic therapies.\n* Boxerman J.L., et al. \"Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast MR Imaging in Glioma: Review of Current Clinical Practice.\" <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2016.06.005>\n* Sujlana, et al. \"Review of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI: Technical aspects and applications in the musculoskeletal system\", <https://doi.org/10.1002/jmri.25810>\nIn neurology, brain perfusion parameters such as Normalized Cerebral Blood Flow (NCBF) and Cerebral Blood Volume (CBV) are relevant hemodynamic parameters, as their changes can precede abnormalities on conventional MR imaging.

It is typically based on dynamic measurement of brain with BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent) contrast which is achievable with T2\\* weighted images (e.g. GRE EPI). Other contrast principles can be used as well (e.g. blood perfusion). Typical spatial resolution ranges from 3 x 3 x 3 mm to 2 x 2 x 2 mm in whole brain coverage, or even up to 0.1 mm in limited field of view and at ultra-high fields (7T or more). Temporal resolution ranges from 3 s to 0.5 s with EPI sequence.\nfMRI can be used in medical research (and diagnostics) as well as psychology, neuroeconomy, and other disciplines related to understanding human brain and behavior. It is typically used to measure neural activity during tasks or following to stimuli (e.g. scenario with auditory, visual or tactile stimuli distributed during the acquisition time to induce required brain activity), but resting-state fMRI is possible too. It allows to obtain activation maps, evaluate the hemodynamic response in selected regions, estimate the functional connection among brain regions, and evaluate the relationship between activity/connectivity and external variables.\nfMRI can be combined with electrophysiological recordings or stimulation.\nA special case is fMRI hyperscanning (dual fMRI) with two participants measured simultaneously in two scanners.\nExample applications include:\n* localization of brain functions and networks\n* monitoring brain changes caused by stress\n* discovering brain changes in various diseases (e.g. Alzheimer disease, Schizophrenia etc)\n* understanding empathy, emotions and consciousness\n* understanding the learning process\n* observing brain plasticity, development, aging affects\n**Available at:**\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Medical and Preclinicial Imaging Hungary](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n## Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST), Magnetization Transfer (MT) MRI\nIn CEST imaging, a radiofrequency pulse is applied at the resonant frequency(ies) of exchangeable protons in a given molecule or metabolite, in order to reach a saturation state. Chemical exchange of the protons with those of water molecules causes the transfer of magnetic saturation to water over time. The subsequent decrease in water signal is detected by standard MR imaging sequences and provides an indirect measure of the concentration of the species of interest.\nCEST MRI can detect a variety of endogenous small molecules (e.g. glucose, glycogen, lactate, creatine, glutamate), proteins and enzymes for molecular imaging. Development of exogenous CEST agents, including diamagnetic CEST (DIACEST), paramagnetic CEST (PARACEST) and liposome-based (LIPOCEST) agents, greatly enhanced the sensitivity and specificity of CEST imaging (Longo D.L. et al.; “A snapshot of the vast array of diamagnetic CEST MRI contrast agents” <https://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.4715>; Ferrauto G. et al.; “LipoCEST and cellCEST imaging agents: opportunities and challenges” <https://doi.org/10.1002/wnan.1385>).\nCEST imaging can provide information on tissue pH, temperature, oxygenation, metabolism, enzymatic reactions as well as for molecular imaging applications. Example applications include several disorders such as acute stroke, renal injury, tumors and multiple sclerosis.\n![](upload/chemicalmri.png)\nApplication of MRI-CEST tumor pH imaging for assessing response to novel anticancer therapies.

The MT contrast is different from T1, T2, and PD, and it likely reflects the structural integrity of the tissue being imaged. Applications include tissue characterization, such as evaluation of multiple sclerosis and other white-matter lesions and in tumors.\nSee also: van Zijl PCM et al.; “Magnetization Transfer Contrast and Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer MRI.

Since the molecular concentrations of these metabolites are at least 10.000 times lower than water, they produce correspondingly much lower signal strengths. Thus, to detect enough signal above noise for quantification, 1H-MRSI must use much larger voxel sizes in comparison to MRI, leading to lower spatial resolution with respect to anatomical imaging. The use of high magnetic fields allows to overcome this issue.\nMRSI is used in the clinics for quantifying metabolic abnormalities in the human brain, prostate, breast and other organs.\nSee for example:\n* T.A.A. Boroeders et al., “Glutamate levels across deep brain structures in patients with a psychotic disorder and its relation with cognitive functioning”, [http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2021...](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.01.21250977)\n* A.A.

Nevertheless, technological progress, development of acquisition methods and the availability of equipment operating at high magnetic fields have made in vivo heteronuclear MRI/MRS possible in both humans and small animals despite sensitivity limitation, widening the number of applications and the range of metabolites that can be mapped by MRS.\nSodium (23Na) MRI has been applied in a large variety of biomedical/clinical research areas. Sodium ions (Na+) play an important role in many cellular physiological processes. An unbalanced concentration gradient across the cell membranes or an increase in the intracellular Na+ content is an early marker of cell viability in many disease processes. 23Na-MRI can be used for studying heart diseases, by exploiting the increase in the extracellular sodium signal in acute ischemia, for cancer investigations, by measuring the increase of sodium content in proliferating cells, and for testing therapies by evaluating the intracellular sodium accumulation due to cell death <https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jacr.2007.07.001>).\n31P MRS can be used to study the energetic metabolism of a wide range of tissues such as muscle, heart, liver, and kidney in various pathological contexts. Using the endogenous 31P signal arising from the tissue, it is possible to obtain information about the energy status and also determine the intracellular pH (from the chemical shift of Pi). 31P signals from inorganic phosphate, adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, creatine phosphate and sugar phosphates can be observed in whole-cell preparations, intact tissues or organs. Phosphate metabolites that are involved in ATP production and utilization can be quantified non-invasively by 31P-MRS/MRI, while 31P magnetization transfer (MT) techniques allow in vivo measurement of metabolic fluxes via creatine kinase (CK) and ATP synthase (<https://doi.org/10.21037%2Fqims.2017.11.03>).\nFor 13C-MRI, hyperpolarized probes are usually used in order to increase the sensitivity of the technique (see Hyperpolarized MRI).\n19F MRI is increasingly emerging as a multi-nuclear (1H/19F) technique that can be exploited for several purposes, e.g. cell tracking, detection of active inflammation, measuring tissue oxygenation and to study fluorinated pharmaceuticals. The lack of a 19F background signal in tissues affords an unequivocal detection suitable for quantification. Fluorine-based contrast agents can be engineered as nanoemulsions, nanocapsules, or nanoparticles to label cells in vitro or in vivo. Multispectral 19F-MRI using different fluorinated compounds could be also used to detect different labeled cells simultaneously. Specific fluorinated products can be used to map pO2 heterogeneity in tissues.

This is particularly true for nuclei other than protons. Hyperpolarized probes are molecules where the nuclei polarization has been artificially raised. Conversely to standard MRI contrast agents, which act on the relaxation of water protons, hyperpolarized molecules are themselves the source of the NMR signal, thus yielding to signal intensity and SNR that linearly depend upon their concentration and polarization level. Long relaxation times of the hyperpolarized nuclei are essential in order to preserve the polarization for as long as possible. For this reason HP-MRI relies on the detection of heteronuclei rather than protons. For most applications 13C-probes are used.\nThe use of hyperpolarized probes allows to obtain very strong signal enhancements, thus overcoming the MR sensitivity issue and making the detection of low concentration biological molecules possible. Hyperpolarized probes are usually employed for perfusion studies and for mapping metabolites and their transformations through MRS in the body. Hyperpolarized metabolic imaging is particularly useful for the early diagnosis of cancer and monitoring of treatments efficacy because it can reveal changes that happen well before the onset of macroscopic signs of the disease. A typical example is the monitoring of pyruvate and lactate levels after injection of hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate.\nOther examples of applications in the preclinical and clinical fields can be found in the following reviews:\n* Z.J.

A difference in respect to MRI of other body regions is that cardiac and respiratory motions cause artifacts. Thus, CMR requires synchronous cardiac and respiratory gating or breath-holding techniques. Cardiac synchronization with ECG is often used to “freeze” the hearth during MR acquisition.\nMRI can also be used to record movies of the cardiac cycle that permit the extraction of a good number of dynamic cardiac parameters (cine MRI).\nFor more details on CMR techniques and applications see:\n* W.-Y.I.

At moderate spatial resolution, MPI provides high sensitivity and superb temporal resolution.\nCurrent main applications are in the preclinical field and include biodistribution of nanoparticles, cell tracking, detection of nanoparticles deployed for thermoablation.\n![](upload/mpict.png)\nMPI-CT image of a mouse: a representative MPI image visualizes SPIO tracer with high image contrast and no signal modulation by biological tissue.

This non-invasive technique is distinguished by its unique ability to provide real-time imaging without ionizing radiation, setting it apart from conventional imaging modalities such as MRI and PET.\n\n### Key Capabilities\nMPI operates by detecting the magnetic signals emitted from SPIONs introduced into the body. The technology features a field-free region (FFR) within the MPI scanner, where the magnetic field strength is zero. As the scanner moves this FFR across the area of interest, the SPIONs become magnetized and demagnetized, generating a detectable electrical signal proportional to their concentration. This process allows MPI to achieve high spatial resolutions on the order of 1 mm and temporal resolutions capable of capturing up to 30 frames per second. The direct detection of the nanoparticle signal, rather than signals from surrounding tissues, results in a clear and accurate representation of the nanoparticle distribution.\n\n### Applications\nMPI has significant applications in various fields of biomedicine, including:\n- **Cancer Imaging**: Monitoring tumor response to therapies and tracking metastasis.\n- **Cardiovascular Imaging**: Assessing blood flow and vascular health.\n- **Drug Delivery Monitoring**: Evaluating the distribution and efficacy of therapeutic agents in real-time.\n- **Cell Tracking**: Visualizing the behavior of labeled cells within living organisms.\n\n### Advantages\nThe advantages of MPI include:\n- **Zero Endogenous Background Signal**: This feature minimizes noise and enhances image clarity, allowing for more precise imaging compared to traditional methods.\n- **Rapid Imaging**: With short scanning times, MPI facilitates dynamic studies and quick assessments of biological processes.\n- **Biocompatibility**: The SPIONs used in MPI are biocompatible and can be safely metabolized and excreted by the body, reducing the risk of adverse effects.\n- **High Spatial and Temporal Resolution**: MPI provides detailed imaging capabilities that are crucial for understanding complex biological processes in real-time.\n\nIn summary, Magnetic Particle Imaging represents a significant advancement in medical imaging technology, offering unique features and capabilities that enhance diagnostic practices and therapeutic monitoring in clinical medicine.\n\n## References\n\n1. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9285659/\n2. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8306580/\n3. https://biologyinsights.com/magnetic-particle-imaging-principles-and-applications/\n\n**AI Enhancement Confidence Score:** 0.95\n",

It is particularly effective in clinical settings for localizing brain functions and planning surgeries, especially for epilepsy and tumor removal. MEG provides a unique combination of high temporal resolution and spatial accuracy, making it a critical tool in both clinical and research applications.\n\n### Key Capabilities\nMEG operates by detecting the extremely weak magnetic fields produced by groups of neurons firing synchronously. The technique utilizes superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) to measure these fields, which are a billionth of the strength of the Earth's magnetic field. The SQUID sensors are maintained at cryogenic temperatures (around -269 degrees Celsius) to enhance sensitivity. MEG can capture brain activity with millisecond precision, allowing for real-time monitoring of dynamic neural processes. \n\n### Applications\n1. **Clinical Applications**: MEG is primarily used for pre-surgical mapping of brain functions in patients with epilepsy, enabling surgeons to identify the precise locations of seizure foci. It is also used to assess brain responses to sensory stimuli, aiding in the diagnosis of various neurological conditions.\n2. **Research Applications**: In cognitive neuroscience, MEG is employed to investigate brain function related to sensory processing, language, and motor control. Its ability to provide both temporal and spatial information makes it invaluable for studying rapid cognitive processes and understanding brain dynamics.\n\n### Advantages\nMEG offers several distinct advantages over other neuroimaging techniques:\n- **Direct Measurement**: Unlike fMRI, which measures blood flow as an indirect indicator of neuronal activity, MEG directly measures the electrical activity of neurons, providing more accurate data on brain function.\n- **High Temporal Resolution**: With a temporal resolution on the order of milliseconds, MEG is capable of tracking fast cognitive processes that other imaging methods cannot capture.\n- **Spatial Resolution**: MEG provides better spatial resolution compared to EEG, allowing for precise localization of brain activity, which is crucial for both clinical diagnosis and research.\n\nIn conclusion, MEG is a powerful tool that combines high temporal and spatial resolution, making it essential for both clinical applications in neurology and advanced research in cognitive neuroscience. Its ability to provide direct measurements of neuronal activity sets it apart from other imaging modalities, enhancing our understanding of brain function and aiding in the treatment of neurological disorders.\n\n## References\n\n1. https://ilabs.uw.edu/what-magnetoencephalography-meg/\n2. https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/17218-magnetoencephalography-meg\n\n**AI Enhancement Confidence Score:** 0.95\n",

This allows to study the structure of large multimolecular protein complexes, such as nuclear pores with unprecedented 3D resolution.\nAdditionally, MINFLUX tracking allows to study movement of single molecules in living cells with up to 10 kHz sampling rate (one localisation each 100 µs, which is up to 100 x faster than conventional camera-based tracking).\nMINFLUX relies on localising individual photoswitchable fluorophores with a movable excitation beam with an intensity minimum, commonly in a donut shape.**\n\n## AI Generated Documentation\n\n**Overview**  Minimal Photon Fluxes Microscopy (MINFLUX) is an advanced super-resolution microscopy technique that enables the localization of single fluorophores with exceptional precision and minimal photon emission. This method combines aspects of single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) and stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, achieving spatial resolutions in the single-digit nanometer range. MINFLUX is particularly effective for imaging dynamic biological processes in live cells, providing insights into molecular interactions and structures at unprecedented detail.\n\n**Key Capabilities**  MINFLUX utilizes a structured excitation beam, typically configured as a doughnut shape, which features a central intensity minimum. This configuration allows for the precise positioning of the excitation beam relative to the fluorophore. When the beam's intensity zero is aligned with the fluorophore, no photons are emitted, thus requiring fewer emitted photons to determine the fluorophore's location. The technique achieves localization precision of less than 2 nm in 2D and less than 3 nm in 3D imaging modes, with each localization event occurring in under 5 microseconds. This rapid imaging capability allows for the tracking of fast molecular movements and interactions over extended periods.\n\n**Applications**  MINFLUX is particularly valuable in the fields of structural biology and biophysics, where it can be used to visualize and track protein complexes, nucleic acids, and other molecular structures in live cells. The high spatiotemporal resolution enables researchers to study dynamic processes such as protein folding, molecular interactions, and cellular signaling pathways in real-time. Additionally, the technique supports multi-color imaging, allowing for the simultaneous observation of multiple targets within the same specimen.\n\n**Advantages**  The primary advantages of MINFLUX include its high resolution, minimal photon requirement, and compatibility with standard fluorescence microscopy setups. By reducing phototoxicity and photobleaching, MINFLUX is well-suited for live-cell imaging, making it a preferred choice for researchers studying dynamic biological systems. Its integration into existing fluorescence microscopy systems enhances its accessibility, allowing researchers to leverage this advanced technology without extensive reconfiguration. Overall, MINFLUX represents a significant advancement in microscopy, providing powerful tools for exploring molecular dynamics with unprecedented detail and efficiency.\n\n## References\n\n1. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-025-01625-0\n2. https://abberior.rocks/knowledge-base/minflux/\n3. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minflux\n\n**AI Enhancement Confidence Score:** 0.95\n",

Due to its exquisite sensitivity, very low amounts of compounds that bind to cellular targets (radioligands) or are substrates for biological processes (radiotracers) can be detected, providing quantitative information about the rate of biological processes or number of receptors within organs and tissues without altering the underlying biology (the ‘tracer’ principle). Nuclear medicine makes use of two major modalities depending on the type of radioisotope used for radiolabelling, namely PET (Positron Emission Tomography) and SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography).**\nPET and SPECT imaging can be performed as single modality acquisition but are more often used in combination with CT (PET-CT, SPECT-CT) or [MRI (PET-MRI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/service/MRI-PET), which allow for precise spatial localization of the PET/SPECT signals within the body.\n\n## AI Generated Documentation\n\n**Overview**  \nPositron Emission Tomography (PET) is a cutting-edge imaging technology that provides detailed insights into metabolic processes within the body. Utilizing radioactive tracers, PET captures gamma rays emitted from positron-electron annihilation events, allowing for the visualization of physiological functions. This technology is particularly valuable in clinical settings for diagnosing and monitoring various diseases, including cancer, neurological disorders, and cardiac conditions.\n\n**Key Capabilities**  \nPET scanners are equipped with a ring of detectors that measure the gamma radiation emitted from the body after the administration of a radiolabeled tracer, commonly fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). The technology achieves a spatial resolution of approximately 4 to 6 mm, enabling precise imaging of metabolic activity. The sensitivity of PET systems typically ranges from 1-2%, allowing for the detection of low levels of radioactivity, which is crucial for identifying early-stage diseases. PET can be combined with CT (Computed Tomography) or MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) to provide anatomical context to the functional data, enhancing diagnostic accuracy.\n\n**Applications**  \nPET is predominantly used in:\n- **Oncology**: It is essential for tumor detection, staging, and monitoring treatment response. PET scans can reveal areas of increased glucose metabolism, indicative of malignant growth.\n- **Neurology**: PET assists in diagnosing conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy, and brain tumors by evaluating cerebral blood flow and glucose utilization.\n- **Cardiology**: The technology is employed to assess myocardial perfusion and viability, aiding in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease and guiding therapeutic decisions.\n\n**Advantages**  \nPET offers several distinct advantages over other imaging modalities:\n- **Functional Imaging**: Unlike CT or MRI, PET provides metabolic and physiological information, allowing for early disease detection.\n- **Reproducibility**: PET scans are consistent and reliable, making them useful for longitudinal studies and treatment monitoring.\n- **Non-invasive**: The procedure is generally well-tolerated, with minimal discomfort for patients.\n\nIn conclusion, PET stands out as a vital tool in both clinical and research settings, offering unique capabilities in metabolic imaging that enhance diagnostic and therapeutic strategies across various medical disciplines.\n\n## References\n\n1. https://omnexus.specialchem.com/selection-guide/polyethylene-terephthalate-pet-plastic/key-applications\n2. https://kbdelta.com/blog/what-is-pet-material-exploring-properties-applications/\n\n**AI Enhancement Confidence Score:** 0.95\n",

      "documentation": "## AI Generated Documentation\n\n**Overview**  \nPhase Contrast Imaging (PCI) is a sophisticated X-ray imaging technique that enhances the visualization of soft tissues and low-contrast materials by utilizing the phase shifts of X-rays as they pass through different media. Unlike conventional X-ray imaging, which primarily relies on differential absorption, PCI captures phase information, allowing for superior contrast in imaging soft tissues, which are often difficult to distinguish in standard X-ray images.\n\n**Key Capabilities**  \nPCI employs various methods, including propagation-based, analyzer-based, and grating interferometry techniques. The propagation-based technique, for instance, analyzes changes in the wavefront of X-rays as they traverse a sample, enabling high-resolution imaging of biological soft tissues. This method can achieve spatial resolutions in the range of micrometers to sub-micrometers, making it suitable for detailed structural analysis. PCI can be implemented in laboratory settings using microfocus X-ray sources and CCD detectors, facilitating its application in both preclinical and clinical environments.\n\n**Applications**  \nThe applications of PCI are extensive and span multiple fields. In the medical domain, it significantly enhances the visualization of soft tissues, aiding in early detection and precise characterization of tumors, detailed imaging of vascular structures, and improved visualization of cartilage and other soft tissues. Furthermore, PCI is invaluable in materials science, where it is used to analyze the microstructure of polymers and composite materials, providing insights into their properties and behaviors. Its capability to visualize intricate details within low-Z materials positions PCI as a critical tool in biological research and industrial applications.\n\n**Advantages**  \nThe primary advantage of PCI lies in its ability to produce high-contrast images of soft tissues, which is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. By overcoming the limitations of conventional X-ray techniques, PCI provides clearer differentiation between tissues that are otherwise indistinguishable. Additionally, PCI opens new avenues in research, allowing scientists to observe fine anatomical details that were previously obscured by traditional imaging methods. As the technology continues to evolve, its integration into routine clinical practice and research is expected to expand, further enhancing its impact across various scientific and medical fields.\n\n## References\n\n1. https://diversedaily.com/phase-contrast-imaging-methods-in-x-ray-imaging-enhancing-soft-tissue-contrast-and-anatomical-visualization/\n2. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23220766/\n3. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0030402613011510\n\n**AI Enhancement Confidence Score:** 0.95\n",

Briefly, the technique detects endogenous or exogenous chromophores that are excited through an illumination carried out with pulsed laser light, typically in the Red-NIR range. The non-radiative release of the absorbed energy produces a microheating and a thermoelastic expansion in the chromophore close surrounding, which can generate ultrasound. The acoustic waves are detected by a transducer and transformed into an image.**\nPAI combines the advantages of optical and US imaging technologies. The detection of the US signal makes it possible to achieve an increase of both spatial resolution (micrometric) and penetration depth with respect to optical imaging and reduces scattering phenomena. Other advantages include good sensitivity (comparable to that of optical imaging), safety, cheapness and ease of use.\nA very large number of chromophores can be used to generate PAI contrast: endogenous molecules (e.g. oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin, myoglobin, melanin), exogenous probes (e.g. organic dyes like fluorescein and ICG), nanosystems (e.g. noble metals-containing nanoparticles, quantum dots, carbon nanotubes, etc.) and also fluorescent proteins and gene reporters. Detection of different types of chromophores in the same anatomical region is also feasible.\nAs any tomographic technique, PAI allows to get 3D-high resolution images of soft tissues which provide anatomical, functional, and molecular information.

Utilizing the photoacoustic effect, where absorbed light energy is converted into ultrasound waves, PAI offers a unique approach to imaging that is both non-invasive and capable of delivering real-time insights into tissue characteristics.\n\n### Key Capabilities\nPAI systems typically consist of a pulsed laser source, ultrasound transducers, and a signal processing unit. The pulsed laser emits light at specific wavelengths that are absorbed by endogenous chromophores such as hemoglobin and melanin, or by exogenous contrast agents. This absorption leads to a rapid thermal expansion, generating ultrasound waves that are detected by transducers. The imaging resolution can reach submillimeter levels at depths of several centimeters, and with adjustments, it can achieve submicrometer resolution for detailed cellular imaging. \n\n### Applications\nPAI is particularly valuable in various medical fields, especially oncology, where it is employed to:\n- **Monitor Blood Flow**: Assessing hemodynamics in tumors and surrounding tissues.\n- **Evaluate Oxygen Saturation**: Measuring blood oxygen levels to understand tumor metabolism.\n- **Visualize Tumor Vasculature**: Producing angiograms to map blood vessel networks in tumors.\n- **Molecular Imaging**: Tracking molecular probes to visualize cancer pathology and response to therapies.\n- **Thermal Monitoring**: Non-invasively mapping temperature changes during thermal therapies, enhancing treatment planning and monitoring.\n\n### Advantages\nThe distinct advantages of PAI include its high spatial resolution combined with the ability to penetrate deeper tissues, making it superior to traditional optical imaging methods. Unlike X-ray or CT imaging, PAI is non-ionizing, reducing patient exposure to harmful radiation. Furthermore, it leverages existing ultrasound technology, making it a cost-effective and portable solution for clinical settings. The integration of functional and structural imaging capabilities allows for comprehensive assessments of tissue health, paving the way for improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in medicine. \n\nIn summary, PhotoAcoustic Imaging stands out as a versatile and powerful tool in the biomedical imaging landscape, offering unique insights into tissue characteristics that are critical for advancing medical diagnostics and treatment outcomes.\n\n## References\n\n1. https://openmedscience.com/photoacoustic-imaging-a-revolutionary-approach-in-biomedical-imaging/\n2. https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/photoacoustic-imaging\n3. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6595011/\n\n**AI Enhancement Confidence Score:** 0.95\n",

The non-radiative release of the absorbed energy produces a microheating and a thermoelastic expansion in the chromophore close surroundings, which can generate ultrasound. The acoustic waves are detected by a transducer and transformed into an image.**\nPAI combines the advantages of optical and US imaging technologies. The detection of the US signal makes it possible to achieve an increase of both spatial resolution (micrometric) and penetration depth with respect to optical imaging and reduces scattering phenomena. Other advantages include good sensitivity (comparable to that of optical imaging), safety, cheapness and ease of use.\nA very large number of chromophores can be used to generate PAI contrast: endogenous molecules (e.g. oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin, myoglobin, melanin), exogenous probes (e.g. organic dyes like fluorescein and ICG), nanosystems (e.g. noble metals-containing nanoparticles, quantum dots, carbon nanotubes, etc.) and also fluorescent proteins and gene reporters. Detection of different types of chromophores in the same anatomical region is also feasible.\nAs any tomographic technique, PAI allows to get 3D-high resolution images of soft tissues which provide anatomical, functional, and molecular information. Due to the not optimal penetration depth, PAI is particularly useful for preclinical imaging, whereas in humans it’s use is limited to superficial organs analysis (e.g. palmar vessels detection, breast analysis). The most important in vivo application of PAI is the detection of blood hemoglobin, which provides a different PA signal depending on its deoxy- or oxy-state, allowing it to evaluate the vascular volume and pO2 in normal and hypoxic conditions.\nOther applications in the preclinical biomedical field include, but are not limited to:\n* oncology (cancer detection, assessment of vascular volume and hypoxia, targeting experiments, assessment of drug distribution and therapy outcome)\n* neurobiology (stroke, brain cancer, intracranial injection of drugs, functional imaging)\n* cardiovascular biology (heart attack, detection of atherosclerotic plaques, hemodynamic and O2 perfusion)\n* in developmental biology (vascular volume and oxygenation of placenta, image-guided embryo injection, fetal analysis)\n* abdomen analysis (kidney diseases as renal microcirculation flow, renal obstruction analysis, gastrointestinal motility, organs’ perfusion)\n* skin analysis (mainly detection of melanin in melanoma cells)\n* image-guided injection of drug\n\n## AI Generated Documentation\n\n**Overview**  \nPhotoacoustic Imaging (PAI) is a hybrid imaging modality that combines the high spatial resolution of ultrasound with the rich optical contrast of light absorption in biological tissues. This technique utilizes pulsed laser light to induce thermal expansion in tissues, generating ultrasound waves that are then detected to create detailed images of tissue structures. PAI is particularly valuable in biomedical research and clinical diagnostics due to its ability to visualize functional and molecular information in vivo without the use of ionizing radiation.\n\n**Key Capabilities**  \nPAI operates primarily in the near-infrared spectrum, allowing for deeper tissue penetration while maintaining high resolution. The imaging system can achieve submillimeter resolution at depths of several centimeters, with the potential for enhanced resolution down to submicrometer levels by sacrificing depth. This capability enables the visualization of fine structures such as microvasculature and cellular components. The technique can also be adapted for various imaging modalities, including 3D imaging and real-time monitoring, making it versatile for different research needs.\n\n**Applications**  \nPAI has a broad range of applications in both preclinical and clinical settings:\n- **Tumor Imaging**: It provides insights into tumor vascularization and metabolic activity by mapping blood oxygenation levels, which is crucial for assessing tumor response to therapies.\n- **Angiography**: PAI allows for detailed imaging of blood vessels, facilitating the diagnosis and treatment of vascular diseases.\n- **Thermal Therapy Monitoring**: The modality can noninvasively track temperature changes during thermal treatments, such as laser ablation, enhancing treatment efficacy.\n- **Molecular Imaging**: By employing specific contrast agents, PAI can visualize molecular pathways and disease processes, aiding in early diagnosis and personalized medicine.\n\n**Advantages**  \nThe non-invasive nature of PAI, combined with its ability to provide real-time imaging, makes it a powerful tool for continuous monitoring of disease progression and treatment response. Unlike traditional imaging techniques that may expose patients to ionizing radiation, PAI utilizes light and sound, offering a safer alternative for repeated imaging. Additionally, the integration of optical and ultrasound imaging enhances tissue characterization, providing critical information for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Overall, Photoacoustic Imaging represents a significant advancement in the field of biomedical imaging, offering unique capabilities that bridge the gap between functional and structural imaging.\n\n## References\n\n1. https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/photoacoustic-imaging\n2. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6595011/\n\n**AI Enhancement Confidence Score:** 0.95\n",

QPI operates on unlabelled specimens and, as such, is complementary to established fluorescence microscopy, exhibiting lower phototoxicity and no photobleaching. QPI is a label-free technique in which various methods (for example off-axis digital holography, wavefront sensing, spatial light interference, ptychography) are used to retrieve the phase information of light passing through the cell. In contrast to traditional qualitative label-free techniques such as phase contrast or DIC, QPI measures the absolute phase delay and is high-contrast. In 2D acquisitions the images represent quantitative maps of optical path length delays introduced by the specimen, which correspond to differences between refractive index of the cellular components and medium, and the length of the optical path within the cell. The phase delay can be directly converted into a dry mass of the cell. In 3D acquisition a spatial distribution of refractive indices is obtained, giving a three-dimensional shape of the cell and its compartments.**\nQPI provides an objective measure of morphology and dynamics, free of variability due to contrast agents not used. QPI data are suitable for image segmentation, making label-free cell counting and tracking easy.\nApplication areas:\nThe interpretation of the phase signal has proven to deliver novel parameters for studying physiological processes in living cells, such as transmembrane fluid flux, dry mass and water content changes, intracellular transport as well as tissue structure and density changes. Protein concentrations, growth and cell motility can be precisely quantified. The morphologies of cells and organelles can be established by phase tomography. Their studies provide information on the biomechanical characteristics of cell structures and membranes. These data are indicative of biomolecular activity, which can be affected by pathology.\n\n## AI Generated Documentation\n\n### Overview\nQuantitative Phase Imaging (QPI) is a cutting-edge optical imaging technique that provides label-free, quantitative assessments of biological specimens by measuring the phase shift of light as it passes through transparent materials.

      "documentation": "## AI Generated Documentation\n\n### Overview\nReversible Optical Fluorescence Transitions (RESOLFT) is a cutting-edge microscopy technique that enables imaging with resolutions significantly below the diffraction limit, achieving spatial resolutions down to 100 nm or less. This method leverages the principles of reversible saturable optical fluorescence transitions, allowing researchers to visualize intricate biological structures and processes that are otherwise undetectable with conventional microscopy techniques.\n\n### Key Capabilities\nRESOLFT microscopy operates by utilizing fluorescent molecules that can be switched between a bright state, which emits fluorescence, and a dark state, which does not. This reversible switching is accomplished through the application of specific light patterns, enabling selective excitation of fluorescent markers. The technique allows for high-resolution imaging by rasterizing the sample and controlling the illumination, effectively overcoming the diffraction limit associated with traditional optical microscopy.\n\nRecent advancements in RESOLFT have introduced multi-sheet imaging capabilities, which employ parallelized light sheets to enhance imaging speed and resolution. This innovation allows for rapid volumetric imaging at rates of 1-2 Hz, facilitating the observation of dynamic cellular processes in real-time. The use of reversibly switchable fluorescent proteins (RSFPs) further enhances the technique's versatility, accommodating various fluorescent markers with minimal switching cycles.\n\n### Applications\nRESOLFT microscopy is particularly valuable in biological research, where it is used to study live cells and complex multicellular systems. It enables detailed observation of subcellular structures, cellular dynamics such as cell division and actin motion, and the behavior of virus-like particles in three dimensions. The ability to visualize these processes in real-time makes RESOLFT an essential tool for researchers investigating cellular mechanisms and interactions.\n\n### Advantages\nThe primary advantage of RESOLFT is its ability to achieve high-resolution imaging without the need for electron microscopy, which often requires extensive sample preparation and can induce damage. By utilizing standard far-field optics and fluorescent markers, RESOLFT provides a less invasive approach to high-resolution imaging, significantly reducing photodamage to live samples. This capability makes it an invaluable tool for real-time studies in cellular biology and nanoscience, distinguishing it from other imaging techniques such as STED and STORM, which may not offer the same level of flexibility and ease of use in live-cell applications.\n\n## References\n\n1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RESOLFT\n2. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-024-02196-8\n3. https://www.microscopyu.com/references/the-resolft-concept\n\n**AI Enhancement Confidence Score:** 0.95\n",

      "documentation": "## Single Molecule Localisation Microscopy (SMLM)\n---\n**There are a variety of widely used implementations of single molecule localization microscopy that are offered at the Euro-BioImaging Nodes. The unifying principle behind them is that a large series of individual images is acquired, in each of which only a small subset of the fluorescent labels in the sample are fluorescing. This sparse nature of the signal allows the computational calculation of the exact position of each of the emitting fluorophores. By combining the large number of images with precise locations, an image with very high resolution can be formed.\nBelow are descriptions of some of the common SMLM techniques.\nThe fundamental principle behind stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) is that the activated state of a photo-switchable molecule must lead to the consecutive emission of sufficient photons to enable precise localization before it enters a dark state or becomes deactivated by photobleaching. Additionally, the sparsely activated fluorescent molecules must be separated by a distance that exceeds the Abbe diffraction limit (in effect, greater than approximately 250 nanometers) to enable the parallel recording of many individual emitters, each having a distinct set of coordinates in the lateral image plane.\nPhoto activated localization microscopy (PALM) is a widefield fluorescence microscopy imaging methods that allow obtaining images with a resolution beyond the diffraction limit. PALM is based on collecting a large number of images each containing just a few active isolated fluorophores. The imaging sequence allows for the many emission cycles necessary to stochastically activate each fluorophore from a non-emissive state to a bright state, and back to a bleached state. During each cycle, the density of activated molecules is kept low enough that the molecular images of individual fluorophores do not typically overlap.\nGround state depletion microscopy followed by individual molecule return (GSDIM or GSD for short) is a super-resolution technique based on single molecule localization. To precisely localize single molecules and create a high-resolution image the ensemble of overlapping fluorophores are temporally \"separated\". This can be achieved by using high power lasers to transfer fluorophores into long-lived \"off states\" – a non-fluorescent molecule state. Single fluorophores return stochastically from the off state and emit bursts of photons, which are recorded. The position of the fluorophore is determined using a software algorithm. Based on this list of coordinates a super-resolution image is reconstructed.**\n\n## AI Generated Documentation\n\n**Overview**  \nSingle Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) is a super-resolution imaging technique that surpasses the diffraction limit of conventional microscopy, allowing for the visualization of biological structures at the molecular level. By utilizing the stochastic switching of fluorescent probes, SMLM can localize individual molecules with high precision, achieving resolutions of 20-50 nanometers. This capability is particularly valuable for studying complex biological systems where understanding molecular interactions and arrangements is crucial.  \n\n**Key Capabilities**  \nSMLM operates by capturing a series of images where only a sparse number of fluorescent molecules are activated at any given time. This allows for the precise localization of these molecules based on their emission patterns. The technique can reconstruct super-resolution images from the accumulated data of thousands to millions of localized molecules. SMLM can be performed in both fixed and live cells, making it versatile for various experimental setups. Additionally, advancements in multicolor SMLM enable simultaneous imaging of multiple targets, providing insights into the spatial relationships and interactions between different biomolecules.  \n\n**Applications**  \nSMLM is widely used in cell biology, biophysics, and neuroscience to study protein dynamics, receptor interactions, and the organization of cellular structures. It has been instrumental in elucidating the mechanisms of synaptic transmission, understanding the dynamics of membrane proteins, and visualizing the architecture of cellular organelles. The ability to resolve structures at the nanoscale has opened new avenues for research in areas such as drug delivery, disease pathology, and cellular signaling.  \n\n**Advantages**  \nThe primary advantage of SMLM over traditional microscopy techniques lies in its ability to provide unprecedented spatial resolution, allowing researchers to visualize molecular details that were previously inaccessible. The technique's reliance on fluorescent probes also enables specific labeling of target molecules, enhancing the specificity of the imaging. Furthermore, the ability to perform multicolor imaging expands its utility in studying complex biological systems, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of molecular interactions and cellular processes. Despite some limitations, such as sensitivity to sample preparation and the need for sophisticated data analysis, SMLM remains a powerful tool in modern biological research, continually evolving with advancements in imaging technology and fluorescent probe development.\n\n## References\n\n1. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s43074-024-00147-2\n2. https://www.nature.com/articles/s43586-021-00038-x\n\n**AI Enhancement Confidence Score:** 0.95\n",

STED can provide 3D datasets of samples, often with resolutions down to 50 nm or less.\n\n## AI Generated Documentation\n\n**Overview**  \nStimulated Emission Depletion Microscopy (STED) is a super-resolution imaging technique that enables the visualization of biological structures at resolutions below the diffraction limit of light, achieving details as fine as 50 nanometers. Developed by Stefan W. Hell and Jan Wichmann in the mid-1990s, STED has become a pivotal tool in cell biology, allowing researchers to observe dynamic processes within living cells with unprecedented clarity.\n\n**Key Capabilities**  \nSTED microscopy employs two laser beams: an excitation beam that activates fluorophores and a depletion beam that selectively deactivates them in a spatially controlled manner. This dual-beam approach minimizes the effective area of fluorescence, enhancing the achievable resolution significantly. The technique can utilize a variety of standard fluorophores, such as Alexa 488 and eGFP, making it adaptable for different experimental setups. Recent advancements include the use of continuous wave lasers (CW-STED) and temporal gating techniques (gSTED), which further improve resolution while reducing phototoxicity to samples. STED is capable of both 2D and 3D imaging, allowing for comprehensive studies of cellular structures and interactions.\n\n**Applications**  \nSTED microscopy is widely used in biological research to investigate cellular dynamics, protein localization, and molecular interactions. Its ability to visualize subcellular structures, such as synapses, organelles, and protein complexes, has provided critical insights into various biological processes. The technique is particularly valuable in live-cell imaging, where it can capture real-time changes in cellular morphology and function. Additionally, STED has applications in materials science for studying nanoscale structures and interactions in synthetic materials.\n\n**Advantages**  \nThe primary advantage of STED over conventional microscopy techniques, such as confocal microscopy, is its ability to achieve resolutions that surpass the diffraction limit, enabling the observation of fine structural details that are otherwise invisible. This capability is crucial for advancing our understanding of complex biological systems. Furthermore, STED's compatibility with a wide range of fluorescent labels enhances its versatility, making it a preferred choice for researchers seeking to explore the intricacies of cellular architecture and dynamics. Overall, STED microscopy stands out as a powerful tool for high-resolution imaging in both biological and materials sciences, driving significant advancements in research and discovery.\n\n## References\n\n1. https://www.nature.com/articles/s43586-024-00335-1\n2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STED_microscopy\n3. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3635273/\n\n**AI Enhancement Confidence Score:** 0.95\n",

      "description": "Spinning disc confocal microscopy is one of the solutions for routine and high-performance fluorescence live-cell imaging applications. SDCM uses a series of moving pinholes on a disc to scan spots of light, in combination with a high-sensitivity camera to acquire instantaneous optical slices. Since a series of pinholes scans an area in parallel, each pinhole is allowed to hover over a specific area for a longer amount of time than on laser scanning confocals (CLSM) thereby reducing the excitation energy needed to illuminate a sample . Furthermore, cameras (often EMCCDs or sCMOS), typically have quantum efficiencies 2-3x higher than PMTs, so much less laser excitation energy is necessary and that reduces photo-toxicity and photo-bleaching of a sample, making it the preferred system for imaging live cells or organisms when optical slicing is necessary. However, optical sectioning in depth is more limited than in CLSM.  This technology can be improved with image scanning mic/pixel reassignment to allow non-diffraction limited images which provide resolutions 100-200nm (check with the lab where these improvements are available).",
      "documentation": "## Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) \\*\n---\n**SIM belongs to the family of super-resolution microscopy techniques that allow to acquire images with higher spatial resolution than with conventional fluorescence microscopy. SIM is a camera based widefield fluorescence microscope employing a patterned illumination, e.g. stripes, to excite the fluorescence in the sample. The diffraction limited structured illumination pattern is the key element that allows to extract higher frequencies from the sample and thus achieve the improved spatial resolution. To obtain one super-resolution image, several images with shifted and rotated illumination patterns projected on the sample are acquired. The set of acquired images is then mathematically processed to reconstruct the super-resolution image. The reachable resolution improvement, both laterally and axially, is twice as better as with conventional widefield microscopy for the same wavelength. Data acquisition for one super-resolution SIM image takes from hundreds of milliseconds to seconds.**\nSIM is a versatile super-resolution technique used for a detailed imaging of cellular structures within cell monolayers or thin tissue sections. The strength of the method lies in the compatibility with a high number of standard fluorophores allowing relatively simple multi-color imaging, and in live-cell imaging friendliness in terms of acquisition speed and used laser powers (phototoxicity) . The downside of SIM compared to other super-resolution techniques (STED, SMLM) is a moderate resolution improvement and proneness to image artifacts formation.\nThere are different realizations of SIM microscopes. Euro-BioImaging nodes offer 2D-SIM, 3D-SIM and TIRF-SIM modalities on commercial setups including DeltaVision OMX, Nikon N-SIM and Carl Zeiss Elyra PS1 systems, which all use sinusoidal striped illumination.\n![](upload/SIM1.png)\n**The principle of conventional light microscopy and structurally illuminated microscopy.** To collect sufficient information, 15 structurally illuminated images in 3 angles and 5 translations per angle are acquired for 1 final reconstructed image in one particular Z-position. The reconstruction of the super-resolution (SR) image is performed in Fourier space (after Fourier transformation (Ft)) when the SR contribution from all 15 images are extracted and aligned back to the newly formed Fourier information. Then, the reverse Fourier transform (rFt) gives the final SR image.\n![](upload/SIM2.png)\n**Examples of images obtained by conventional widefield fluorescence microscopy (left) and structured illumination microscopy (right).** SIM image clearly shows improved resolution. The images of actin (green) and mitochondria (red) are presented as maximum intensity projections and were acquired on DeltaVision OMX microscope (Institute of Molecular Genetics, Czech Republic).\n\n",

In neuroscience, it is instrumental in mapping neuronal activity and understanding synaptic transmission dynamics. In pharmacology, it aids in investigating the effects of drugs on cellular ion homeostasis and pH regulation, providing insights into mechanisms of action and potential side effects. Additionally, this technology is crucial in cancer research, where it helps elucidate the ionic imbalances within tumor microenvironments and their implications for disease progression and treatment efficacy. Furthermore, advancements in pH-sensitive fluorescent proteins have expanded its use in monitoring organelle-specific pH changes, particularly in mitochondria, which are essential for understanding metabolic processes.\n\n**Advantages**  \nThe distinct advantages of Voltage/pH/Ion Imaging include its non-invasive nature, allowing for real-time monitoring of live cells without disrupting cellular integrity.

      "documentation": "## X-rays Computed Tomography (CT)\n---\n**X-rays Computed Tomography (CT) makes use of X-ray images (projections) taken from different angles and image reconstruction techniques to produce anatomic cross-sectional (tomographic) 3D  images. CT contrast agents (usually based on Iodine, Barium, Gold) can be used to enhance the contrast.**\nIn microCT, the instrumentation is implemented with accessories or with a technical set-up which provides optimum resolution and sensitivity for small animal studies.\nThe spatial resolution of microCT is higher with respect to clinical CT and typically the voxel size is lower than 100 mm for *in vivo* imaging and even smaller (less than 10 mm) for *ex-vivo* sample imaging. In order to achieve high spatial resolution a microfocus X-ray source is installed on microCT scanners.\nAnother difference with respect to clinical CT scanners is the use of flat panel detectors (FPD) with small pixel sizes (less than 100 mm) instead of curved detectors arrays. The use of a FPD results in a cone beam acquisition geometry. In this case, dedicated image reconstruction algorithms, such as the Feldkamp filtered back projection (FBP) algorithm, are needed.\nPreclinical microCT systems can be stand alone or integrated with other modalities like optical or nuclear medicine imaging in order to perform multimodal imaging.  microCT devices can be also found in small animal radiotherapy systems for animal positioning and treatment planning.\n**At Euro-BioImaging, preclinical and ex-vivo CT is provided by the following Nodes:**\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI) (CZ)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed - DIMP NEUROMED](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Facility of Multimodal Imaging - AMMI Maastricht (NL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/facility-of-excellence-in-imaging---alm-and-molecular-imaging-node-maastricht)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Hungary: Medical and Preclinical Imaging Hungary (HU)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Preclinical Imaging Centre (PRIME) - Molecular Imaging Dutch Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node)\n### Use cases\nClick here for\n[Use Cases](/content/use-cases/#CT) from our Nodes.\n## Dual energy CT\nDual energy CT (DECT) was firstly introduced in 1976 with the main\ngoal of obtaining the photoelectric and Compton components of the\nabsorption coefficients using a polychromatic x-ray beam with\ndifferent energies. These two components are respectively proportional\nto atomic number (Z) and density of the material (r) (R.E. Alvarez and\nE. Macovski, “Energy-selective reconstructions in X-ray computerized\ntomography”,\n<https://doi.org/10.1088/0031-9155/21/5/002>).\nBy using DECT acquisitions it is thus possible to obtain rZ maps to\ngain material-specific information at each voxel as shown in the\nfigure below.\n![](upload/microCT.png)\nDECT imaging enables quantitative, 3D mapping of extrinsic contrast\nagents (iodine, red; gold, green) and soft tissues (gray) (from\n<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmp.2021.07.005>).\nA significant boost of DECT came in 2006 with the introduction of dual\nsource CT. In this case two x-ray tubes operating at different tension\nare orthogonally mounted in the gantry and both high and low tension\nimages are acquired (axial or spiral mode) at the same time, reducing\nartifacts induced by movement (T.G. Flohr et al. “First performance\nevaluation of a dual-source CT (DSCT) system”,\n<https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-005-2919-2>).\n## Photon counting CT\nCurrent CT scanners are mostly based on scintillator energy\nintegrating detectors and it is thus not possible to gain information\nabout the energy of the detected x-ray photons. Photons counting\ndetectors (PCD) were firstly introduced for nuclear medicine imaging\nmodalities and their application for x-ray CT was limited by the low\ndetector rate PCD can handle.  However, considering also the\ndevelopments of DECT, there has been a significant research interest\nin improving their material composition and reading electronics.\nA PCD is made of a semiconductor (e.g. Cadmium Telluride) where the\ninteraction with the incoming x-ray generates positive and negative\ncharges proportional to the energy of the incoming photons. Different\nsignal thresholds corresponding to different energy values can be set\nin order to divide the detected transmitted x-ray spectrum into\ndifferent energy bins.\nThe use of PCD is particularly important for DECT as shown in the\nfigure below, where DECT imaging of a mouse using PCD is presented. In\nthis example, material decomposition into three basis materials was\nperformed.\n![](upload/microCT1.png)\nExample of photon-counting CT in a mouse. Material decomposition was\nperformed into iodine (red), photoelectric effect (PE, green), and\nCompton scattering (gray) (from\n<https://doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0218417>)\n## K-Edge subtraction CT\nIn subtraction X-ray imaging, tissue structures or organs are\nvisualized using a contrast medium and measuring the changes in the\nattenuation between the contrasted structure and the surrounding\ntissue. In K-edge subtraction (KES) imaging, two X-ray images are\ntaken at different mean energies, slightly below and a bit above the\nK-edge of the contrast agent photoelectric absorption. Their\nsubtraction generates an image only displaying the contrasted\nstructure.\nSo far, this method mostly relies on monochromatic X-rays produced at\nlarge synchrotron facilities.\nKES allows to differentiate similarly absorbing substances in contrast\nenhanced CT, such as for example commonly used iodine contrast agents\nand calcium which is typically seen in calcifications, kidney stones\nand bones.\n## Phase contrast CT\nOne of the main limitations of CT is the poor contrast of low Z\nmaterials, e.g. soft tissues, because of similar X-ray absorption. In\norder to solve this problem the diffraction and refraction of the\nX-rays can be exploited to obtain more information about the structure\nof the object. This technique is called Phase Contrast Imaging. See\nPhase Contrast CT Imaging for more information\n[here](/service/phase-contrast-imaging-PCI).\n\n## AI Generated Documentation\n\n**Ex-Vivo Micro-CT: Detailed Overview**  \nEx-vivo micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) is a sophisticated imaging technology designed for high-resolution, three-dimensional visualization of biological samples that have been excised from living organisms. This technique is particularly valuable in biomedical research, where it facilitates the detailed study of tissue architecture, vascular structures, and biomaterials without the limitations imposed by live imaging.  \n\n**Key Capabilities**  \nEx-vivo micro-CT systems are characterized by their ability to achieve voxel resolutions as fine as 1-10 micrometers, enabling researchers to capture intricate details of biological structures. These systems operate with longer scan times, allowing for higher radiation doses that improve signal-to-noise ratios and overall image quality. Notable systems, such as Bruker’s Skyscan 1272 and 1273, utilize higher energy X-rays to effectively image denser biological materials, including bone and soft tissues, while specialized techniques like microangioCT employ novel contrast agents to visualize microvascular networks in unprecedented detail.  \n\n**Applications**  \nThe applications of ex-vivo micro-CT are extensive and include:  \n- **Tissue Analysis**: Endpoint studies of excised organs (e.g., lungs, tumors) to assess pathological changes or treatment effects.  \n- **Vascular Imaging**: Utilizing advanced contrast agents for detailed visualization of blood vessels, enabling studies of angiogenesis and vascular integrity.  \n- **Material Studies**: Evaluation of biomaterials and implants, assessing integration and structural performance in biological environments.  \n\n**Advantages**  \nEx-vivo micro-CT offers several distinct advantages over in-vivo imaging techniques:  \n- **Higher Spatial Resolution**: The ability to achieve finer imaging details makes it ideal for studying small anatomical features and complex structures.  \n- **Flexibility in Sample Preparation**: Researchers can manipulate and prepare samples extensively without the constraints of maintaining life functions, allowing for more complex experimental designs.  \n- **Correlative Analysis**: The imaging data can be integrated with subsequent morphological studies, providing a comprehensive understanding of the sample’s structure and function.  \n\nIn conclusion, ex-vivo micro-CT is an essential tool in preclinical research, enabling detailed insights into biological structures and processes, with broad applications in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and material science.\n\n## References\n\n1. https://www.bruker.com/en/news-and-events/webinars/2020/ex-vivo-microangioct-advances-in-microvascular-imaging.html\n2. https://www.microphotonics.com/what-is-the-difference-between-in-vivo-micro-ct-and-ex-vivo-micro-ct-scanning/\n3. https://www.raycisionglobal.com/products/ex-vivo-micro-ct-imaging-system/\n\n**AI Enhancement Confidence Score:** 0.95\n",

A variety of bioluminescent and/or fluorescent probes can be used, each targeted to a specific tissue or molecular or cellular event.**\nOptical Imaging is particularly useful for visualizing cells that have been engineered to express reporter genes, provided that they are located not too deep in the body.\nMost preclinical applications are in oncology and neuroscience research, but optical imaging is also used for cardiovascular studies and to monitor gene therapy, infectious diseases, inflammation, metabolic diseases and drug metabolism.\nBioluminescence Imaging of a lung tumor mouse model (courtesy of San Raffaele Hospital, Molecular Imaging Italian Node)\nWithin Euro-BioImaging, preclinical in vivo optical Imaging is provided by the following Nodes:\n[• Austria BioImaging Node / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n[• Brain Imaging Network (PT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n[• Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging, CAPI (CZ)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n[• Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n[• Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n[• Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n[• Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n[• DIMP Neuromed Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed)\n[• Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n[• Medical and Preclinical Imaging Hungary (HU)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n[• NORMOLIM (NO)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)\n[• PRIME Node (NL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node)\n### Use cases\nClick here for\n[Use Cases](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/content/use-cases/#OI) from our Nodes.\n## Fluorescence in vivo Imaging (NIR I, NIR II)\nIn vivo Fluorescence imaging is based on the detection of fluorescence\nemitted by fluorescent reporters either in Near InfraRed I (NIR I,\nwavelength range 700-900 nm) or in Near InfraRed II (NIR II, or SWIR -\nShort Wave InfraRed - wavelength in the range 1000-2000 nm) in living\nlaboratory animals, most usually mice.\nThe NIR I \"optical window\" covers regions where light is not much\nabsorbed by hemoglobin and water, thus allowing the signal coming from\ninner organs to be detected. The low autofluorescence of skin and\nurine results in a good ratio of signal to background.\nFluorescence is usually emitted by NIR I dyes linked to tracked\nmolecules or particles but NIR I proteins have also been developed.\nThe optical window for in vivo optical imaging in NIR II can even\nincrease the benefits with respect to imaging in NIR I. In fact,\nalthough absorption of light by water is higher than in NIR I, lower\nscattering and lower autofluorescence enable the visualization of fine\nstructures such as e.g. blood vessels with a better quality. The\ndrawback of NIR II in vivo imaging is the small number of\nbiocompatible fluorophores and commercially available optical imagers.\nSee also: M. Hassan and B.A. Klaunberg, “Biomedical applications of\nfluorescence imaging in vivo”, [https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/aalas/cm/2004/00000054/00000006/art00006](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/aalas/cm/2004/00000054/00000006/art00006#)\n**Available at:**\n[• CAPI Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n[• Danish BioImaging](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n[• Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n[• Molecular Imaging Italian Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n[• NORMOLIM](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)\n[• Medical and Preclinicial Imaging Hungary](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n## Bioluminescence Imaging (BLI)\nBioluminescence Imaging is based on the detection of light emitted by\nenzymes (e.g. luciferase) transfected (or transducted) to laboratory\ncell lines or animals from other organisms, for example fireflies.\nInteraction of the enzymes with their substrates is needed for light\nemission: for this reason, substrates are injected into the animal or\nadded to cultivation media before the imaging session.\nThe bioluminescence signal is relatively low compared to fluorescence,\nbut the background is limited to digital noise and therefore the signal\nto noise ratio can be excellent. Example applications of BLI are the\ntracking of stem cells or viability of tissues transplanted from animals\nexpressing bioluminescent enzymes into non-luminescent animals, in vivo\nstudies of infection (with bioluminescent pathogens) and cancer\nprogression (e.g. using bioluminescent cancer cell lines).\nSee for example: P.E. Almeida et al., “In vivo bioluminescence for\ntracking cell fate and function”,\n<https://doi.org/10.1152%2Fajpheart.00337.2011>; M. Hutchens and G.D. Luker “Applications of bioluminescence imaging\nto the study of infectious diseases”,\n<https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-5822.2007.00995.x>; N. Alsawaftah et al., “Bioluminescence Imaging Applications in\nCancer: A Comprehensive Review”,\n<https://doi.org/10.1109/rbme.2020.2995124>\nLight can also be produced by chemical reactions in living bodies\n(chemiluminescence). An example is the reaction of luminol with hydrogen\nperoxide which can be used in vivo for the localization of infiltrated\nneutrophils by monitoring the activity of myeloperoxidase (<https://doi.org/10.1038/nm.1886>).\n**Available at:**\n* [CAPI Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [NORMOLIM](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)\n* [Medical and Preclinicial Imaging Hungary](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n## Cerenkov Radiation Imaging and Radio Luminescence Imaging\nCerenkov radiation is a blue light emitted when charged particles (e.g. electrons) move through dielectric materials faster than light. Sensitive optical imagers can localize therapeutic isotopes emitting Cerenkov radiation, for example Yttrium-90 or Terbium-161, in small animals. No significant changes in imaging procedures are required for Cerenkov Imaging, other than replacing injection of a bioluminescent substrate with that of a radiotracer.\nCerenkov and RadioLuminescence Imaging can be used to image the spatial distribution and concentration of therapeutic radionuclides, visualize gene expression, imaging guided surgery at preclinical level.\nSee also:\n* D.L.J.

When light impinges upon layered structures, backscattered light from interfaces in the sample interferes with a reference light beam, forming modulated interferogram, which can in turn lead to the reconstruction of inner structures of biological samples in vivo. By using wideband low coherence light sources, OCT can achieve subcellular spatial resolution as well as high temporal resolution. In addition to structural imaging, an extension of OCT, namely OCT angiography (OCTA), can produce contrast based on speckle or phase variance, which has seen increasing applications in ophthalmology (<https://doi.org/10.1097%2FICU.0b013e32835f8bf8>) and dermatology (<https://doi.org/10.1117/1.jbo.18.6.061224>).\n![](upload/ivoi2.png)\nmicro-OCT Imaging of corneal scar in an animal model (<https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-29761-4>)\nAvailable at:\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Brain Imaging Network](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Danish BioImaging](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n## Imaging guided surgery\nDuring tumor resection, clear differentiation between normal and cancerous tissues is critical for increasing the negative margin rates. The difference in fluorescence intensity between the normal and cancer tissues can be enhanced by the use of fluorescent probes targetting the tumor of interest, making it easier to distinguish cancer tissue from normal tissue during intervention.\nSee for example:\n* K. Teranishi, “Near-Infrared Fluorescence Imaging of Renal Cell Carcinoma with ASP5354 in a Mouse Model for Intraoperative Guidance” <https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23137228>\n* A.Pagoto et al. “Novel Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor Targeted Near-Infrared Fluorescence Dye for Image-Guided Surgery of Prostate Cancer” <https://doi.org/10.1007/s11307-019-01354-1>\n\n## AI Generated Documentation\n\n**Overview:**  In vivo optical imaging (OI) is a cutting-edge, non-invasive imaging technology that utilizes light to visualize biological processes in real time within living organisms. This technique is particularly advantageous in preclinical research, allowing for the monitoring of disease progression, therapeutic efficacy, and molecular interactions in small animal models. OI encompasses various modalities, including fluorescence and bioluminescence imaging, which provide unique insights into cellular and molecular dynamics.\n\n**Key Capabilities:**  In vivo OI employs advanced techniques such as fluorescence imaging, which utilizes fluorescent probes that emit light upon excitation, and bioluminescence imaging, which relies on naturally occurring light from biochemical reactions. These methods can achieve high spatial resolution and depth penetration, enabling detailed observations of biological structures and functions. Technologies like two-photon microscopy and multispectral imaging further enhance the capabilities of OI, allowing researchers to visualize complex interactions at the cellular level with minimal invasiveness.\n\n**Applications:**  The applications of in vivo OI are extensive and include cancer research, neurobiology, and cardiovascular studies. For example, it is used to track tumor growth, assess drug delivery mechanisms, and monitor the biological effects of therapies in real time. In neuroscience, OI enables the visualization of hemodynamic changes and neuronal activity, providing insights into brain function and disorders. Additionally, OI is increasingly applied in studies of infectious diseases, allowing for the observation of pathogen dynamics in live models.\n\n**Advantages:**  One of the primary advantages of in vivo OI is its high sensitivity and specificity without the use of ionizing radiation, making it a safer alternative to other imaging modalities like MRI or PET. The technology is also relatively cost-effective and allows for longitudinal studies, enabling researchers to image the same subjects over time to observe changes and responses to treatment. Overall, in vivo optical imaging is a versatile and essential tool in modern biomedical research, offering unique insights into the dynamic processes of living organisms while maintaining a non-invasive approach.\n\n## References\n\n1. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6776895/\n2. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2435254/\n\n**AI Enhancement Confidence Score:** 0.95\n",

Intravital Imaging can be performed using 2-photon microscopy, light-sheet microscopy or others. The choice is usually made based on the required penetration depth and resolution. These techniques can be combined with optical manipulation systems, such as laser ablation or optogenetic manipulation systems, and also with a range of e.g. neurological or behavioral stimuli especially when awake, immobilized animals are imaged.**\nIntravital imaging allows the real-time visualization of cellular processes in their native environment in the living organism. It can be performed as repetitive imaging on the same animal, allowing biological processes to be tracked over long periods of time, or as acute experiments.\nSome Euro-BioImaging Nodes offer Intravital Imaging in direct association with animal houses, which is required especially for chronic or repeated imaging.\nIntravital microscopy is used for a wide variety of applications where dynamic processes in intact tissue environments need to be understood (see the review articles below for a range of examples). These include various analyses of vascular function, following the migration and cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions of e.g. immune cells or invasive/metastatic tumor cells in different tissues, and changes in e.g. neuronal or astrocyte morphology in response to stimulus or injury. Intravital brain imaging is increasingly done in awake rodents, which allows the integration of e.g. sensory cues for analysis of behavioral responses. A constantly increasing variety of functional probes can also be used for intravital microscopy, including calcium indicators, environmental sensors, FRET probes and enzyme-activated probes.\n**REFERENCES.**\n* Pittet M.J., Weissleder R. “Intravital imaging”, <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2011.11.004>\n* Secklehner J. et al. “Intravital microscopy in historic and contemporary immunology”, <https://doi.org/10.1038/icb.2017.25>\n* Coste A. et al. “Intravital Imaging Techniques for Biomedical and Clinical Research”, <https://doi.org/10.1002/cyto.a.23963>\n* Murphy K.J. et al. “Quantifying and visualising the nuances of cellular dynamics in vivo using intravital imaging”<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceb.2021.04.007>\n![](upload/ivmright.png)\n![](upload/ivmleft.png)\n*2-photon intravital microscopy images of living mouse ear skin, captured at the Biomedicum Imaging Unit In Vivo Imaging (BIU-IVI), part of Helsinki In Vivo Animal Imaging Platform (HAIP) in the Finnish Biomedical Imaging (FiBI) EuBI Node.*\n**IVM is available at the following Nodes:**\n* [Advanced Light and Electron Microscopy Node Prague CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-and-electron-microscopy-node-prague-cz)\n* [EMBL Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-facility-embl)\n* [Facility of Multimodal Imaging - AMMI Maastricht](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/facility-of-excellence-in-imaging---alm-and-molecular-imaging-node-maastricht)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [French BioImaging Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/french-bioimaging-node)\n* [Israel BioImaging](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Portuguese Platform of BioImaging PPBI](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/portuguese-platform-of-bioimaging-ppbi)\n* [PRIME Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node)\n* [Swedish National Microscopy Infrastructure NMI](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/swedish-national-microscopy-infrastructure-nmi)\n| Use cases | Node | DOI |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Longitudinal two-photon imaging in somatosensory cortex of behaving mice reveals dendritic spine formation enhancement by subchronic administration of low-dose ketamine | [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node) | <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-24933-8> |\n\n## AI Generated Documentation\n\n**Overview**  \nIntravital microscopy (IVM-med) is a cutting-edge imaging technology designed for real-time visualization of biological processes within living organisms.

CT contrast agents (usually based on Iodine, Barium, Gold) can be used to enhance the contrast.**\nIn microCT, the instrumentation is implemented with accessories or with a technical set-up which provides optimum resolution and sensitivity for small animal studies.\nThe spatial resolution of microCT is higher with respect to clinical CT and typically the voxel size is lower than 100 mm for *in vivo* imaging and even smaller (less than 10 mm) for *ex-vivo* sample imaging. In order to achieve high spatial resolution a microfocus X-ray source is installed on microCT scanners.\nAnother difference with respect to clinical CT scanners is the use of flat panel detectors (FPD) with small pixel sizes (less than 100 mm) instead of curved detectors arrays. The use of a FPD results in a cone beam acquisition geometry. In this case, dedicated image reconstruction algorithms, such as the Feldkamp filtered back projection (FBP) algorithm, are needed.\nPreclinical microCT systems can be stand alone or integrated with other modalities like optical or nuclear medicine imaging in order to perform multimodal imaging.  microCT devices can be also found in small animal radiotherapy systems for animal positioning and treatment planning.\n**At Euro-BioImaging, preclinical and ex-vivo CT is provided by the following Nodes:**\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI) (CZ)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed - DIMP NEUROMED](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Facility of Multimodal Imaging - AMMI Maastricht (NL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/facility-of-excellence-in-imaging---alm-and-molecular-imaging-node-maastricht)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Hungary: Medical and Preclinical Imaging Hungary (HU)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Preclinical Imaging Centre (PRIME) - Molecular Imaging Dutch Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node)\n### Use cases\nClick here for\n[Use Cases](/content/use-cases/#CT) from our Nodes.\n## Dual energy CT\nDual energy CT (DECT) was firstly introduced in 1976 with the main\ngoal of obtaining the photoelectric and Compton components of the\nabsorption coefficients using a polychromatic x-ray beam with\ndifferent energies. These two components are respectively proportional\nto atomic number (Z) and density of the material (r) (R.E. Alvarez and\nE. Macovski, “Energy-selective reconstructions in X-ray computerized\ntomography”,\n<https://doi.org/10.1088/0031-9155/21/5/002>).\nBy using DECT acquisitions it is thus possible to obtain rZ maps to\ngain material-specific information at each voxel as shown in the\nfigure below.\n![](upload/microCT.png)\nDECT imaging enables quantitative, 3D mapping of extrinsic contrast\nagents (iodine, red; gold, green) and soft tissues (gray) (from\n<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmp.2021.07.005>).\nA significant boost of DECT came in 2006 with the introduction of dual\nsource CT. In this case two x-ray tubes operating at different tension\nare orthogonally mounted in the gantry and both high and low tension\nimages are acquired (axial or spiral mode) at the same time, reducing\nartifacts induced by movement (T.G. Flohr et al. “First performance\nevaluation of a dual-source CT (DSCT) system”,\n<https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-005-2919-2>).\n## Photon counting CT\nCurrent CT scanners are mostly based on scintillator energy\nintegrating detectors and it is thus not possible to gain information\nabout the energy of the detected x-ray photons. Photons counting\ndetectors (PCD) were firstly introduced for nuclear medicine imaging\nmodalities and their application for x-ray CT was limited by the low\ndetector rate PCD can handle.  However, considering also the\ndevelopments of DECT, there has been a significant research interest\nin improving their material composition and reading electronics.\nA PCD is made of a semiconductor (e.g. Cadmium Telluride) where the\ninteraction with the incoming x-ray generates positive and negative\ncharges proportional to the energy of the incoming photons. Different\nsignal thresholds corresponding to different energy values can be set\nin order to divide the detected transmitted x-ray spectrum into\ndifferent energy bins.\nThe use of PCD is particularly important for DECT as shown in the\nfigure below, where DECT imaging of a mouse using PCD is presented. In\nthis example, material decomposition into three basis materials was\nperformed.\n![](upload/microCT1.png)\nExample of photon-counting CT in a mouse. Material decomposition was\nperformed into iodine (red), photoelectric effect (PE, green), and\nCompton scattering (gray) (from\n<https://doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0218417>)\n## K-Edge subtraction CT\nIn subtraction X-ray imaging, tissue structures or organs are\nvisualized using a contrast medium and measuring the changes in the\nattenuation between the contrasted structure and the surrounding\ntissue. In K-edge subtraction (KES) imaging, two X-ray images are\ntaken at different mean energies, slightly below and a bit above the\nK-edge of the contrast agent photoelectric absorption. Their\nsubtraction generates an image only displaying the contrasted\nstructure.\nSo far, this method mostly relies on monochromatic X-rays produced at\nlarge synchrotron facilities.\nKES allows to differentiate similarly absorbing substances in contrast\nenhanced CT, such as for example commonly used iodine contrast agents\nand calcium which is typically seen in calcifications, kidney stones\nand bones.\n## Phase contrast CT\nOne of the main limitations of CT is the poor contrast of low Z\nmaterials, e.g. soft tissues, because of similar X-ray absorption. In\norder to solve this problem the diffraction and refraction of the\nX-rays can be exploited to obtain more information about the structure\nof the object. This technique is called Phase Contrast Imaging. See\nPhase Contrast CT Imaging for more information\n[here](/service/phase-contrast-imaging-PCI).\n\n## AI Generated Documentation\n\n**Overview**  \nMicro-computed tomography (micro-CT or μCT) is a cutting-edge imaging technology that provides high-resolution, three-dimensional (3D) visualization of small objects through X-ray imaging.

MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields, radiofrequency pulses, and field gradients to generate images of soft tissues throughout the body.**\nContrast agents based on paramagnetic compounds are commonly used to enhance the signal/noise ratio and assess vascularization or tissue permeability. More recently,  novel classes of contrast agents have been developed, such as hyperpolarized molecules for high sensitivity metabolic studies, or CEST agents for accurate pH parametric imaging.\nMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) can be used to complement MRI in the characterization of tissues. While MRI makes use of water proton signals to create images, MRS uses either proton or heteronuclei signals to determine the relative concentrations of metabolites within a specific organ/tissue.\nMRI scanners at high magnetic fields have the advantage to significantly increase the sensitivity and thus improve the image resolution and scan duration. MRS also benefits from high magnetic fields with an increased spectral resolution, which improves the separation between different chemical components. Nowadays, scanners at 3-7 Tesla are commonly used for both humans and animals, but for small-medium animal studies high field scanners operating at 7-9.4T are also quite common. Ultra-high field MR systems with fields of up to 17 T are also available mainly for preclinical studies.\nIn microMRI/MRS, the instruments are technically optimized for small animal studies, providing resolution in the mm to µm range.\nMRI, either as a single modality or paired to other imaging modalities, is largely used for *in vivo* (humans and animals) studies and also for ex-vivo analysis of specimens (organs or tissue samples).\nIn preclinical imaging, animal models of various pathologies, from tumors to cardiovascular, neurological or metabolic disorders, are commonly used to monitor disease development and to test the efficacy of therapeutic treatments, to develop novel diagnostic tools etc. Several quantitative imaging biomarkers can be used to monitor disease progression over time.\nAnimal imaging can also be used for veterinary studies.\nAt clinical level, MRI is generally a key tool for the diagnosis of various pathologies and for monitoring the efficacy of new therapies. It is also commonly used in studies involving healthy volunteers to evaluate metabolism or functions.\nMRI comprises a large number of techniques for various applications ranging from simple morphological measurements throughout all organs to the evaluation of complex systems, functions, and processes in living organisms.\n**Preclinical and ex-vivo MRI**is provided by the following Nodes:\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed - DIMP NEUROMED](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Facility of Multimodal Imaging - AMMI Maastricht (NL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/facility-of-excellence-in-imaging---alm-and-molecular-imaging-node-maastricht)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Medical and Preclinical Imaging Hungary (HU)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Population Imaging Node Valencia (ES)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/population-imaging-valencia)\n* [Preclinical Imaging Centre (PRIME) - Molecular Imaging Dutch Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node)\n* [NORMOLIM, Norwegian Molecular Imaging Infrastructure](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)\n**Human MRI** is provided by the following Nodes:\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Population Imaging Node Valencia (ES)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/population-imaging-valencia)\n### Use cases\nClick here for\n[Use Cases](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/preclinical-and-medical-imaging-technologies-use-cases-from-our-nodes/) from our Nodes.\n## Anatomical, volumetric, morphometric MRI\nContrast in MRI images is generated by the differences in the nuclear relaxation times of water protons (T1 and T2) across tissues. The image contrast can be controlled by changing the values of specific acquisition parameters, generally the echo time (TE) and the repetition time (TR). Depending on their values, it is possible to obtain images where the contrast and brightness are predominantly determined by the T1 or T2 properties of water in tissues (T1-weighted and T2-weighted images respectively).\nContrast agents are frequently administered to enhance the contrast for assessment of organ functions (perfusion, vascularity, permeability) or better delineation of specific lesions or tissues. Mainly Gd based molecules are used with the acquisition of T1-weighted images and for specific cases iron Oxides could be used with T2-weighted images.\nThe acquisition of anatomical MR images is done with the scope of obtaining detailed morphological information ( shape, size, volume, texture…) of various body regions or lesions (e.g. tumors, ischemia, cysts etc) and to monitor disease progression or regression.\n* Kinnunen K. M., et al. \"Volumetric MRI-Based Biomarkers in Huntington's Disease: An Evidentiary Review\", <https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.712555>\n* McCarthy J., et al. \"Morphometric MRI as a diagnostic biomarker of frontotemporal dementia: A systematic review to determine clinical applicability\", <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2018.08.028>\nWhile MR images are typically assessed in a qualitative way, MRI can collect quantitative information about tissue properties. The range of properties includes the magnetic resonance (MR) relaxation times T1 and T2, T2\\*, diffusion, perfusion, fat and water fractions, iron fraction, elastic properties of tissue, temperature, chemical composition, and chemical exchange, just to mention some. Of note, new MRI methods are constantly being developed. By using the sensitivity of MRI to these tissue properties, it is possible to generate quantitative maps instead of qualitative anatomical images, where the intensity of each pixel corresponds to a measurement of one specific physical or physiological property. Quantitative measurements could help not only for identifying anatomical abnormalities but also for detecting initial loss of function or tissue alteration.\n[Use cases](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/content/use-cases/#volumetric)\n**Available at:**\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed - DIMP NEUROMED](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Facility of Multimodal Imaging - AMMI Maastricht (NL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/facility-of-excellence-in-imaging---alm-and-molecular-imaging-node-maastricht)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Medical and Preclinical Imaging Hungary (HU)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Preclinical Imaging Centre (PRIME) - Molecular Imaging Dutch Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node)\n* [NORMOLIM, Norwegian Molecular Imaging Infrastructure](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Medical and Preclinicial Imaging Hungary](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n## Relaxation mapping - T1, T2, T2\\*, spin-lock MR techniques\nThe signal intensity in  MR images is  a function of water content, tissue properties and of MRI acquisition parameters.\nFor quantitative MR imaging, tissue relaxation times are measured by extracting the signal exponential decay (T2 or T2\\*) or recovery (T1) from multiple measurements.  T1, T2 and/or T1rho parametric images can be acquired.\nThe quantification of relaxation times provides more detailed information on the tissue characteristics (tumor cells invasion, ischemic lesions, vascular leakage, iron deposition, inflammation etc), thus supporting the clinicians in the diagnostic process. Furthermore, relaxation maps are used to quantitatively assess the presence of exogenous contrast agents.\nExample applications:\n* Evaluation of the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix in cartilage (T.J.

Diffusion imaging is used to obtain important information about water movements within the architecture of tissues. This is achieved by using MRI sequences specifically designed to  measure the values of the water diffusion coefficient (Diffusion Weighted Imaging) and its components along the 3D space (Diffusion Tensor imaging).\nNeither contrast agents nor specific instrumentation are requested for this kind of experiments.\nDiffusion MRI is used to evaluate the molecular function and micro-architecture of tissues, and it acts as a tool for monitoring treatment response and disease progression for a variety of pathologies such as tumors, white matter diseases, inflammatory diseases and so on.

In the first case, dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC)-MRI, which measures the signal loss in T2- or T2\\*-weighted images, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI, which measures the signal loss in T1-weighted images, are used. In the latter case, arterial spin-labeling (ASL) is used.\nWhile ASL is mainly applied for the measurement of cerebral perfusion, DSC and DCE-MRI are used in a wider variety of clinical applications, including the classification of tumors, stroke regions, and characterization of other diseases, as well as for assessing response to antiangiogenic therapies.\n* Boxerman J.L., et al. \"Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast MR Imaging in Glioma: Review of Current Clinical Practice.\" <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2016.06.005>\n* Sujlana, et al. \"Review of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI: Technical aspects and applications in the musculoskeletal system\", <https://doi.org/10.1002/jmri.25810>\nIn neurology, brain perfusion parameters such as Normalized Cerebral Blood Flow (NCBF) and Cerebral Blood Volume (CBV) are relevant hemodynamic parameters, as their changes can precede abnormalities on conventional MR imaging. Thus, knowledge of whether a lesion identified in anatomic images is associated with increased or decreased CBF or CBV can frequently help narrow the differential diagnosis.\n![](upload/asl-mrileft.png)\n![](upload/asl-mriright.png)\nMR images (A) and parameter maps calculated from data of both dynamic susceptibility-contrast MRI (B), and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (C), obtained from a patient with anaplastic astrocytoma in the frontal lobe of the brain.

It is typically based on dynamic measurement of brain with BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent) contrast which is achievable with T2\\* weighted images (e.g. GRE EPI). Other contrast principles can be used as well (e.g. blood perfusion). Typical spatial resolution ranges from 3 x 3 x 3 mm to 2 x 2 x 2 mm in whole brain coverage, or even up to 0.1 mm in limited field of view and at ultra-high fields (7T or more). Temporal resolution ranges from 3 s to 0.5 s with EPI sequence.\nfMRI can be used in medical research (and diagnostics) as well as psychology, neuroeconomy, and other disciplines related to understanding human brain and behavior. It is typically used to measure neural activity during tasks or following to stimuli (e.g. scenario with auditory, visual or tactile stimuli distributed during the acquisition time to induce required brain activity), but resting-state fMRI is possible too. It allows to obtain activation maps, evaluate the hemodynamic response in selected regions, estimate the functional connection among brain regions, and evaluate the relationship between activity/connectivity and external variables.\nfMRI can be combined with electrophysiological recordings or stimulation.\nA special case is fMRI hyperscanning (dual fMRI) with two participants measured simultaneously in two scanners.\nExample applications include:\n* localization of brain functions and networks\n* monitoring brain changes caused by stress\n* discovering brain changes in various diseases (e.g. Alzheimer disease, Schizophrenia etc)\n* understanding empathy, emotions and consciousness\n* understanding the learning process\n* observing brain plasticity, development, aging affects\n**Available at:**\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Medical and Preclinicial Imaging Hungary](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n## Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST), Magnetization Transfer (MT) MRI\nIn CEST imaging, a radiofrequency pulse is applied at the resonant frequency(ies) of exchangeable protons in a given molecule or metabolite, in order to reach a saturation state. Chemical exchange of the protons with those of water molecules causes the transfer of magnetic saturation to water over time. The subsequent decrease in water signal is detected by standard MR imaging sequences and provides an indirect measure of the concentration of the species of interest.\nCEST MRI can detect a variety of endogenous small molecules (e.g. glucose, glycogen, lactate, creatine, glutamate), proteins and enzymes for molecular imaging. Development of exogenous CEST agents, including diamagnetic CEST (DIACEST), paramagnetic CEST (PARACEST) and liposome-based (LIPOCEST) agents, greatly enhanced the sensitivity and specificity of CEST imaging (Longo D.L. et al.; “A snapshot of the vast array of diamagnetic CEST MRI contrast agents” <https://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.4715>; Ferrauto G. et al.; “LipoCEST and cellCEST imaging agents: opportunities and challenges” <https://doi.org/10.1002/wnan.1385>).\nCEST imaging can provide information on tissue pH, temperature, oxygenation, metabolism, enzymatic reactions as well as for molecular imaging applications. Example applications include several disorders such as acute stroke, renal injury, tumors and multiple sclerosis.\n![](upload/chemicalmri.png)\nApplication of MRI-CEST tumor pH imaging for assessing response to novel anticancer therapies.

From [https://doi.org/10.3892/ijo.20...](https://doi.org/10.3892/ijo.2017.4029)\nMagnetization transfer (MT) is based on the observation of the immobile (restricted) hydrogen pool (protons bound to large macromolecular proteins and lipids, such as those found in such cellular membranes as myelin) throughout saturation of this restricted pool and detection on the mobile proton pool. The MT contrast is different from T1, T2, and PD, and it likely reflects the structural integrity of the tissue being imaged. Applications include tissue characterization, such as evaluation of multiple sclerosis and other white-matter lesions and in tumors.\nSee also: van Zijl PCM et al.; “Magnetization Transfer Contrast and Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer MRI.

Since the molecular concentrations of these metabolites are at least 10.000 times lower than water, they produce correspondingly much lower signal strengths. Thus, to detect enough signal above noise for quantification, 1H-MRSI must use much larger voxel sizes in comparison to MRI, leading to lower spatial resolution with respect to anatomical imaging. The use of high magnetic fields allows to overcome this issue.\nMRSI is used in the clinics for quantifying metabolic abnormalities in the human brain, prostate, breast and other organs.\nSee for example:\n* T.A.A. Boroeders et al., “Glutamate levels across deep brain structures in patients with a psychotic disorder and its relation with cognitive functioning”, [http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2021...](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.01.21250977)\n* A.A.

Nevertheless, technological progress, development of acquisition methods and the availability of equipment operating at high magnetic fields have made in vivo heteronuclear MRI/MRS possible in both humans and small animals despite sensitivity limitation, widening the number of applications and the range of metabolites that can be mapped by MRS.\nSodium (23Na) MRI has been applied in a large variety of biomedical/clinical research areas. Sodium ions (Na+) play an important role in many cellular physiological processes. An unbalanced concentration gradient across the cell membranes or an increase in the intracellular Na+ content is an early marker of cell viability in many disease processes. 23Na-MRI can be used for studying heart diseases, by exploiting the increase in the extracellular sodium signal in acute ischemia, for cancer investigations, by measuring the increase of sodium content in proliferating cells, and for testing therapies by evaluating the intracellular sodium accumulation due to cell death <https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jacr.2007.07.001>).\n31P MRS can be used to study the energetic metabolism of a wide range of tissues such as muscle, heart, liver, and kidney in various pathological contexts. Using the endogenous 31P signal arising from the tissue, it is possible to obtain information about the energy status and also determine the intracellular pH (from the chemical shift of Pi). 31P signals from inorganic phosphate, adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, creatine phosphate and sugar phosphates can be observed in whole-cell preparations, intact tissues or organs. Phosphate metabolites that are involved in ATP production and utilization can be quantified non-invasively by 31P-MRS/MRI, while 31P magnetization transfer (MT) techniques allow in vivo measurement of metabolic fluxes via creatine kinase (CK) and ATP synthase (<https://doi.org/10.21037%2Fqims.2017.11.03>).\nFor 13C-MRI, hyperpolarized probes are usually used in order to increase the sensitivity of the technique (see Hyperpolarized MRI).\n19F MRI is increasingly emerging as a multi-nuclear (1H/19F) technique that can be exploited for several purposes, e.g. cell tracking, detection of active inflammation, measuring tissue oxygenation and to study fluorinated pharmaceuticals. The lack of a 19F background signal in tissues affords an unequivocal detection suitable for quantification. Fluorine-based contrast agents can be engineered as nanoemulsions, nanocapsules, or nanoparticles to label cells in vitro or in vivo. Multispectral 19F-MRI using different fluorinated compounds could be also used to detect different labeled cells simultaneously. Specific fluorinated products can be used to map pO2 heterogeneity in tissues.

This is particularly true for nuclei other than protons. Hyperpolarized probes are molecules where the nuclei polarization has been artificially raised. Conversely to standard MRI contrast agents, which act on the relaxation of water protons, hyperpolarized molecules are themselves the source of the NMR signal, thus yielding to signal intensity and SNR that linearly depend upon their concentration and polarization level. Long relaxation times of the hyperpolarized nuclei are essential in order to preserve the polarization for as long as possible. For this reason HP-MRI relies on the detection of heteronuclei rather than protons. For most applications 13C-probes are used.\nThe use of hyperpolarized probes allows to obtain very strong signal enhancements, thus overcoming the MR sensitivity issue and making the detection of low concentration biological molecules possible. Hyperpolarized probes are usually employed for perfusion studies and for mapping metabolites and their transformations through MRS in the body. Hyperpolarized metabolic imaging is particularly useful for the early diagnosis of cancer and monitoring of treatments efficacy because it can reveal changes that happen well before the onset of macroscopic signs of the disease. A typical example is the monitoring of pyruvate and lactate levels after injection of hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate.\nOther examples of applications in the preclinical and clinical fields can be found in the following reviews:\n* Z.J.

A difference in respect to MRI of other body regions is that cardiac and respiratory motions cause artifacts. Thus, CMR requires synchronous cardiac and respiratory gating or breath-holding techniques. Cardiac synchronization with ECG is often used to “freeze” the hearth during MR acquisition.\nMRI can also be used to record movies of the cardiac cycle that permit the extraction of a good number of dynamic cardiac parameters (cine MRI).\nFor more details on CMR techniques and applications see:\n* W.-Y.I.

These systems provide high-resolution imaging and metabolic analysis of biological samples, enabling researchers to explore intricate anatomical and biochemical details that are critical for understanding various diseases and developing new therapies.\n\n**Key Capabilities**  \nMicro-MRI/MRS systems, such as the Bruker Avance 7T and PharmaScan 7T, are equipped with advanced superconducting magnets and specialized imaging coils that facilitate high-resolution imaging. The Bruker Avance 7T features a wide-bore design with UltraShield™ technology, allowing for minimal interference and high-quality imaging of small samples. Typical imaging resolutions can reach sub-100 µm, enabling detailed visualization of microstructural features in tissues. The systems support a variety of imaging protocols, including T1, T2, DWI, CSI, and DCE-MRI, as well as single voxel spectroscopy, making them versatile for both anatomical and metabolic studies.\n\n**Applications**  \nThese technologies are widely utilized in neuroscience, oncology, and pharmacology. For example, ex-vivo imaging of human brain specimens at 100 µm resolution has provided unprecedented insights into neuroanatomy, aiding in the understanding of neurological disorders. Additionally, micro-MRI/MRS is crucial for preclinical studies of drug efficacy and toxicity, allowing researchers to monitor metabolic changes in tissues and tumors. The ability to analyze fixed samples enhances the detail and accuracy of the findings compared to in-vivo imaging approaches.\n\n**Advantages**  \nThe primary advantages of micro-MRI/MRS (<7 T) systems include their non-invasive nature, high spatial resolution, and the ability to provide comprehensive anatomical and functional information from ex-vivo samples. The cryogen-free designs, such as the MRS*DRYMAG 7.0T, eliminate the need for liquid helium, reducing operational costs and environmental impact. Furthermore, the combination of high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy capabilities allows for a more thorough understanding of biological processes, making these systems invaluable in advancing biomedical research and clinical applications.\n\n## References\n\n1. https://www.mrsolutions.com/mr-imaging/mr-imaging/mr-dry-magnet-cryogen-free/mr-7t/\n2. http://www.mmmi.unito.it/it/content/mrimrs-instruments\n3. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0254-8\n\n**AI Enhancement Confidence Score:** 0.95\n",

MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields, radiofrequency pulses, and field gradients to generate images of soft tissues throughout the body.**\nContrast agents based on paramagnetic compounds are commonly used to enhance the signal/noise ratio and assess vascularization or tissue permeability. More recently,  novel classes of contrast agents have been developed, such as hyperpolarized molecules for high sensitivity metabolic studies, or CEST agents for accurate pH parametric imaging.\nMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) can be used to complement MRI in the characterization of tissues. While MRI makes use of water proton signals to create images, MRS uses either proton or heteronuclei signals to determine the relative concentrations of metabolites within a specific organ/tissue.\nMRI scanners at high magnetic fields have the advantage to significantly increase the sensitivity and thus improve the image resolution and scan duration. MRS also benefits from high magnetic fields with an increased spectral resolution, which improves the separation between different chemical components. Nowadays, scanners at 3-7 Tesla are commonly used for both humans and animals, but for small-medium animal studies high field scanners operating at 7-9.4T are also quite common. Ultra-high field MR systems with fields of up to 17 T are also available mainly for preclinical studies.\nIn microMRI/MRS, the instruments are technically optimized for small animal studies, providing resolution in the mm to µm range.\nMRI, either as a single modality or paired to other imaging modalities, is largely used for *in vivo* (humans and animals) studies and also for ex-vivo analysis of specimens (organs or tissue samples).\nIn preclinical imaging, animal models of various pathologies, from tumors to cardiovascular, neurological or metabolic disorders, are commonly used to monitor disease development and to test the efficacy of therapeutic treatments, to develop novel diagnostic tools etc. Several quantitative imaging biomarkers can be used to monitor disease progression over time.\nAnimal imaging can also be used for veterinary studies.\nAt clinical level, MRI is generally a key tool for the diagnosis of various pathologies and for monitoring the efficacy of new therapies. It is also commonly used in studies involving healthy volunteers to evaluate metabolism or functions.\nMRI comprises a large number of techniques for various applications ranging from simple morphological measurements throughout all organs to the evaluation of complex systems, functions, and processes in living organisms.\n**Preclinical and ex-vivo MRI**is provided by the following Nodes:\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed - DIMP NEUROMED](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Facility of Multimodal Imaging - AMMI Maastricht (NL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/facility-of-excellence-in-imaging---alm-and-molecular-imaging-node-maastricht)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Medical and Preclinical Imaging Hungary (HU)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Population Imaging Node Valencia (ES)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/population-imaging-valencia)\n* [Preclinical Imaging Centre (PRIME) - Molecular Imaging Dutch Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node)\n* [NORMOLIM, Norwegian Molecular Imaging Infrastructure](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)\n**Human MRI** is provided by the following Nodes:\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Population Imaging Node Valencia (ES)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/population-imaging-valencia)\n### Use cases\nClick here for\n[Use Cases](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/preclinical-and-medical-imaging-technologies-use-cases-from-our-nodes/) from our Nodes.\n## Anatomical, volumetric, morphometric MRI\nContrast in MRI images is generated by the differences in the nuclear relaxation times of water protons (T1 and T2) across tissues. The image contrast can be controlled by changing the values of specific acquisition parameters, generally the echo time (TE) and the repetition time (TR). Depending on their values, it is possible to obtain images where the contrast and brightness are predominantly determined by the T1 or T2 properties of water in tissues (T1-weighted and T2-weighted images respectively).\nContrast agents are frequently administered to enhance the contrast for assessment of organ functions (perfusion, vascularity, permeability) or better delineation of specific lesions or tissues. Mainly Gd based molecules are used with the acquisition of T1-weighted images and for specific cases iron Oxides could be used with T2-weighted images.\nThe acquisition of anatomical MR images is done with the scope of obtaining detailed morphological information ( shape, size, volume, texture…) of various body regions or lesions (e.g. tumors, ischemia, cysts etc) and to monitor disease progression or regression.\n* Kinnunen K.

The range of properties includes the magnetic resonance (MR) relaxation times T1 and T2, T2\\*, diffusion, perfusion, fat and water fractions, iron fraction, elastic properties of tissue, temperature, chemical composition, and chemical exchange, just to mention some. Of note, new MRI methods are constantly being developed. By using the sensitivity of MRI to these tissue properties, it is possible to generate quantitative maps instead of qualitative anatomical images, where the intensity of each pixel corresponds to a measurement of one specific physical or physiological property. Quantitative measurements could help not only for identifying anatomical abnormalities but also for detecting initial loss of function or tissue alteration.\n[Use cases](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/content/use-cases/#volumetric)\n**Available at:**\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed - DIMP NEUROMED](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Facility of Multimodal Imaging - AMMI Maastricht (NL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/facility-of-excellence-in-imaging---alm-and-molecular-imaging-node-maastricht)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Medical and Preclinical Imaging Hungary (HU)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Preclinical Imaging Centre (PRIME) - Molecular Imaging Dutch Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node)\n* [NORMOLIM, Norwegian Molecular Imaging Infrastructure](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Medical and Preclinicial Imaging Hungary](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n## Relaxation mapping - T1, T2, T2\\*, spin-lock MR techniques\nThe signal intensity in  MR images is  a function of water content, tissue properties and of MRI acquisition parameters.\nFor quantitative MR imaging, tissue relaxation times are measured by extracting the signal exponential decay (T2 or T2\\*) or recovery (T1) from multiple measurements.  T1, T2 and/or T1rho parametric images can be acquired.\nThe quantification of relaxation times provides more detailed information on the tissue characteristics (tumor cells invasion, ischemic lesions, vascular leakage, iron deposition, inflammation etc), thus supporting the clinicians in the diagnostic process.

Diffusion imaging is used to obtain important information about water movements within the architecture of tissues. This is achieved by using MRI sequences specifically designed to  measure the values of the water diffusion coefficient (Diffusion Weighted Imaging) and its components along the 3D space (Diffusion Tensor imaging).\nNeither contrast agents nor specific instrumentation are requested for this kind of experiments.\nDiffusion MRI is used to evaluate the molecular function and micro-architecture of tissues, and it acts as a tool for monitoring treatment response and disease progression for a variety of pathologies such as tumors, white matter diseases, inflammatory diseases and so on.

In the first case, dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC)-MRI, which measures the signal loss in T2- or T2\\*-weighted images, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI, which measures the signal loss in T1-weighted images, are used. In the latter case, arterial spin-labeling (ASL) is used.\nWhile ASL is mainly applied for the measurement of cerebral perfusion, DSC and DCE-MRI are used in a wider variety of clinical applications, including the classification of tumors, stroke regions, and characterization of other diseases, as well as for assessing response to antiangiogenic therapies.\n* Boxerman J.L., et al. \"Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast MR Imaging in Glioma: Review of Current Clinical Practice.\" <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2016.06.005>\n* Sujlana, et al. \"Review of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI: Technical aspects and applications in the musculoskeletal system\", <https://doi.org/10.1002/jmri.25810>\nIn neurology, brain perfusion parameters such as Normalized Cerebral Blood Flow (NCBF) and Cerebral Blood Volume (CBV) are relevant hemodynamic parameters, as their changes can precede abnormalities on conventional MR imaging.

It is typically based on dynamic measurement of brain with BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent) contrast which is achievable with T2\\* weighted images (e.g. GRE EPI). Other contrast principles can be used as well (e.g. blood perfusion). Typical spatial resolution ranges from 3 x 3 x 3 mm to 2 x 2 x 2 mm in whole brain coverage, or even up to 0.1 mm in limited field of view and at ultra-high fields (7T or more). Temporal resolution ranges from 3 s to 0.5 s with EPI sequence.\nfMRI can be used in medical research (and diagnostics) as well as psychology, neuroeconomy, and other disciplines related to understanding human brain and behavior. It is typically used to measure neural activity during tasks or following to stimuli (e.g. scenario with auditory, visual or tactile stimuli distributed during the acquisition time to induce required brain activity), but resting-state fMRI is possible too. It allows to obtain activation maps, evaluate the hemodynamic response in selected regions, estimate the functional connection among brain regions, and evaluate the relationship between activity/connectivity and external variables.\nfMRI can be combined with electrophysiological recordings or stimulation.\nA special case is fMRI hyperscanning (dual fMRI) with two participants measured simultaneously in two scanners.\nExample applications include:\n* localization of brain functions and networks\n* monitoring brain changes caused by stress\n* discovering brain changes in various diseases (e.g. Alzheimer disease, Schizophrenia etc)\n* understanding empathy, emotions and consciousness\n* understanding the learning process\n* observing brain plasticity, development, aging affects\n**Available at:**\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Medical and Preclinicial Imaging Hungary](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n## Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST), Magnetization Transfer (MT) MRI\nIn CEST imaging, a radiofrequency pulse is applied at the resonant frequency(ies) of exchangeable protons in a given molecule or metabolite, in order to reach a saturation state. Chemical exchange of the protons with those of water molecules causes the transfer of magnetic saturation to water over time. The subsequent decrease in water signal is detected by standard MR imaging sequences and provides an indirect measure of the concentration of the species of interest.\nCEST MRI can detect a variety of endogenous small molecules (e.g. glucose, glycogen, lactate, creatine, glutamate), proteins and enzymes for molecular imaging. Development of exogenous CEST agents, including diamagnetic CEST (DIACEST), paramagnetic CEST (PARACEST) and liposome-based (LIPOCEST) agents, greatly enhanced the sensitivity and specificity of CEST imaging (Longo D.L. et al.; “A snapshot of the vast array of diamagnetic CEST MRI contrast agents” <https://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.4715>; Ferrauto G. et al.; “LipoCEST and cellCEST imaging agents: opportunities and challenges” <https://doi.org/10.1002/wnan.1385>).\nCEST imaging can provide information on tissue pH, temperature, oxygenation, metabolism, enzymatic reactions as well as for molecular imaging applications. Example applications include several disorders such as acute stroke, renal injury, tumors and multiple sclerosis.\n![](upload/chemicalmri.png)\nApplication of MRI-CEST tumor pH imaging for assessing response to novel anticancer therapies.

The MT contrast is different from T1, T2, and PD, and it likely reflects the structural integrity of the tissue being imaged. Applications include tissue characterization, such as evaluation of multiple sclerosis and other white-matter lesions and in tumors.\nSee also: van Zijl PCM et al.; “Magnetization Transfer Contrast and Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer MRI.

Since the molecular concentrations of these metabolites are at least 10.000 times lower than water, they produce correspondingly much lower signal strengths. Thus, to detect enough signal above noise for quantification, 1H-MRSI must use much larger voxel sizes in comparison to MRI, leading to lower spatial resolution with respect to anatomical imaging. The use of high magnetic fields allows to overcome this issue.\nMRSI is used in the clinics for quantifying metabolic abnormalities in the human brain, prostate, breast and other organs.\nSee for example:\n* T.A.A. Boroeders et al., “Glutamate levels across deep brain structures in patients with a psychotic disorder and its relation with cognitive functioning”, [http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2021...](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.01.21250977)\n* A.A.

Nevertheless, technological progress, development of acquisition methods and the availability of equipment operating at high magnetic fields have made in vivo heteronuclear MRI/MRS possible in both humans and small animals despite sensitivity limitation, widening the number of applications and the range of metabolites that can be mapped by MRS.\nSodium (23Na) MRI has been applied in a large variety of biomedical/clinical research areas. Sodium ions (Na+) play an important role in many cellular physiological processes. An unbalanced concentration gradient across the cell membranes or an increase in the intracellular Na+ content is an early marker of cell viability in many disease processes. 23Na-MRI can be used for studying heart diseases, by exploiting the increase in the extracellular sodium signal in acute ischemia, for cancer investigations, by measuring the increase of sodium content in proliferating cells, and for testing therapies by evaluating the intracellular sodium accumulation due to cell death <https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jacr.2007.07.001>).\n31P MRS can be used to study the energetic metabolism of a wide range of tissues such as muscle, heart, liver, and kidney in various pathological contexts. Using the endogenous 31P signal arising from the tissue, it is possible to obtain information about the energy status and also determine the intracellular pH (from the chemical shift of Pi). 31P signals from inorganic phosphate, adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, creatine phosphate and sugar phosphates can be observed in whole-cell preparations, intact tissues or organs. Phosphate metabolites that are involved in ATP production and utilization can be quantified non-invasively by 31P-MRS/MRI, while 31P magnetization transfer (MT) techniques allow in vivo measurement of metabolic fluxes via creatine kinase (CK) and ATP synthase (<https://doi.org/10.21037%2Fqims.2017.11.03>).\nFor 13C-MRI, hyperpolarized probes are usually used in order to increase the sensitivity of the technique (see Hyperpolarized MRI).\n19F MRI is increasingly emerging as a multi-nuclear (1H/19F) technique that can be exploited for several purposes, e.g. cell tracking, detection of active inflammation, measuring tissue oxygenation and to study fluorinated pharmaceuticals. The lack of a 19F background signal in tissues affords an unequivocal detection suitable for quantification. Fluorine-based contrast agents can be engineered as nanoemulsions, nanocapsules, or nanoparticles to label cells in vitro or in vivo. Multispectral 19F-MRI using different fluorinated compounds could be also used to detect different labeled cells simultaneously. Specific fluorinated products can be used to map pO2 heterogeneity in tissues.

This is particularly true for nuclei other than protons. Hyperpolarized probes are molecules where the nuclei polarization has been artificially raised. Conversely to standard MRI contrast agents, which act on the relaxation of water protons, hyperpolarized molecules are themselves the source of the NMR signal, thus yielding to signal intensity and SNR that linearly depend upon their concentration and polarization level. Long relaxation times of the hyperpolarized nuclei are essential in order to preserve the polarization for as long as possible. For this reason HP-MRI relies on the detection of heteronuclei rather than protons. For most applications 13C-probes are used.\nThe use of hyperpolarized probes allows to obtain very strong signal enhancements, thus overcoming the MR sensitivity issue and making the detection of low concentration biological molecules possible. Hyperpolarized probes are usually employed for perfusion studies and for mapping metabolites and their transformations through MRS in the body. Hyperpolarized metabolic imaging is particularly useful for the early diagnosis of cancer and monitoring of treatments efficacy because it can reveal changes that happen well before the onset of macroscopic signs of the disease. A typical example is the monitoring of pyruvate and lactate levels after injection of hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate.\nOther examples of applications in the preclinical and clinical fields can be found in the following reviews:\n* Z.J.

A difference in respect to MRI of other body regions is that cardiac and respiratory motions cause artifacts. Thus, CMR requires synchronous cardiac and respiratory gating or breath-holding techniques. Cardiac synchronization with ECG is often used to “freeze” the hearth during MR acquisition.\nMRI can also be used to record movies of the cardiac cycle that permit the extraction of a good number of dynamic cardiac parameters (cine MRI).\nFor more details on CMR techniques and applications see:\n* W.-Y.I. Tseng et al., “Introduction to Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance: Technical Principles and Clinical Applications”, <https://doi.org/10.6515%2FACS20150616A>\n* Saeed M., Van T.

For instance, it can be applied to assess the decrease of ejection fraction (EF%) in the heart upon multiple administrations of Doxorubicin for cancer treatment.\n![](upload/CMR.png)\nMRI of heart in diastole or systole for ctrl untreated mice and mice treated with doxorubicin.

This technology leverages advanced imaging sequences and high-performance hardware to achieve unparalleled spatial resolution and sensitivity, making it a powerful tool for both research and clinical applications.\n\n**Key Capabilities**  \nMicro-MRI/MRS systems operating at 7 T can achieve isotropic resolutions as fine as 100 µm, which is crucial for visualizing intricate anatomical structures. For example, a study utilized a custom-built 31-channel receive coil and a single-echo multi-flip Fast Low-Angle SHot (FLASH) sequence to produce high-fidelity images of an ex-vivo human brain specimen. The imaging process can be extensive, with some protocols requiring over 100 hours of scan time to ensure the highest quality data. The technology also supports multimodal imaging techniques, integrating structural MRI, diffusion MRI, and quantitative susceptibility mapping to provide a comprehensive view of brain microstructure and connectivity.\n\n**Applications**  \nThe applications of micro-MRI/MRS are diverse and impactful. It is particularly valuable in neuroanatomical studies, allowing researchers to visualize small brain structures and tracts that are often difficult to assess in vivo due to motion artifacts and lower resolution. This capability is essential for understanding neurodegenerative diseases, brain injuries, and developmental disorders. Additionally, the integration of imaging data with histopathological findings enhances diagnostic accuracy and research outcomes, facilitating a deeper understanding of both normal and pathological brain conditions.\n\n**Advantages**  \nThe advantages of micro-MRI/MRS (≥ 7 T) ex-vivo include:  \n1. **High Resolution**: Achieving resolutions down to 100 µm allows for detailed anatomical delineation, surpassing traditional imaging methods.  \n2. **Enhanced Contrast**: Improved signal-to-noise ratios and sensitivity to magnetic susceptibility provide clearer images of complex structures, aiding in accurate diagnosis.  \n3. **Integration with Histopathology**: The ability to correlate imaging findings with histological data enhances the understanding of disease mechanisms and supports clinical decision-making.  \n4. **Diverse Applications**: Useful in both basic research and clinical settings, this technology is instrumental in studies of neurodegenerative diseases, brain injuries, and developmental disorders, making it a versatile tool in modern biomedical research.\n\n## References\n\n1. https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17816\n2. https://eurradiolexp.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41747-023-00389-y\n3. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0254-8\n\n**AI Enhancement Confidence Score:** 0.95\n",

      "documentation": "## Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\n---\n**Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non invasive imaging technique used to obtain 2D/3D \"in vivo\" images representing anatomy and physiological processes (e.g. dynamic perfusion or dynamic changes in blood oxygenation for functional brain mapping, metabolism etc), with high spatial and temporal resolution. MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields, radiofrequency pulses, and field gradients to generate images of soft tissues throughout the body.**\nContrast agents based on paramagnetic compounds are commonly used to enhance the signal/noise ratio and assess vascularization or tissue permeability. More recently,  novel classes of contrast agents have been developed, such as hyperpolarized molecules for high sensitivity metabolic studies, or CEST agents for accurate pH parametric imaging.\nMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) can be used to complement MRI in the characterization of tissues. While MRI makes use of water proton signals to create images, MRS uses either proton or heteronuclei signals to determine the relative concentrations of metabolites within a specific organ/tissue.\nMRI scanners at high magnetic fields have the advantage to significantly increase the sensitivity and thus improve the image resolution and scan duration. MRS also benefits from high magnetic fields with an increased spectral resolution, which improves the separation between different chemical components. Nowadays, scanners at 3-7 Tesla are commonly used for both humans and animals, but for small-medium animal studies high field scanners operating at 7-9.4T are also quite common. Ultra-high field MR systems with fields of up to 17 T are also available mainly for preclinical studies.\nIn microMRI/MRS, the instruments are technically optimized for small animal studies, providing resolution in the mm to µm range.\nMRI, either as a single modality or paired to other imaging modalities, is largely used for *in vivo* (humans and animals) studies and also for ex-vivo analysis of specimens (organs or tissue samples).\nIn preclinical imaging, animal models of various pathologies, from tumors to cardiovascular, neurological or metabolic disorders, are commonly used to monitor disease development and to test the efficacy of therapeutic treatments, to develop novel diagnostic tools etc. Several quantitative imaging biomarkers can be used to monitor disease progression over time.\nAnimal imaging can also be used for veterinary studies.\nAt clinical level, MRI is generally a key tool for the diagnosis of various pathologies and for monitoring the efficacy of new therapies. It is also commonly used in studies involving healthy volunteers to evaluate metabolism or functions.\nMRI comprises a large number of techniques for various applications ranging from simple morphological measurements throughout all organs to the evaluation of complex systems, functions, and processes in living organisms.\n**Preclinical and ex-vivo MRI**is provided by the following Nodes:\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed - DIMP NEUROMED](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Facility of Multimodal Imaging - AMMI Maastricht (NL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/facility-of-excellence-in-imaging---alm-and-molecular-imaging-node-maastricht)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Medical and Preclinical Imaging Hungary (HU)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Population Imaging Node Valencia (ES)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/population-imaging-valencia)\n* [Preclinical Imaging Centre (PRIME) - Molecular Imaging Dutch Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node)\n* [NORMOLIM, Norwegian Molecular Imaging Infrastructure](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)\n**Human MRI** is provided by the following Nodes:\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Population Imaging Node Valencia (ES)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/population-imaging-valencia)\n### Use cases\nClick here for\n[Use Cases](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/preclinical-and-medical-imaging-technologies-use-cases-from-our-nodes/) from our Nodes.\n## Anatomical, volumetric, morphometric MRI\nContrast in MRI images is generated by the differences in the nuclear relaxation times of water protons (T1 and T2) across tissues. The image contrast can be controlled by changing the values of specific acquisition parameters, generally the echo time (TE) and the repetition time (TR). Depending on their values, it is possible to obtain images where the contrast and brightness are predominantly determined by the T1 or T2 properties of water in tissues (T1-weighted and T2-weighted images respectively).\nContrast agents are frequently administered to enhance the contrast for assessment of organ functions (perfusion, vascularity, permeability) or better delineation of specific lesions or tissues. Mainly Gd based molecules are used with the acquisition of T1-weighted images and for specific cases iron Oxides could be used with T2-weighted images.\nThe acquisition of anatomical MR images is done with the scope of obtaining detailed morphological information ( shape, size, volume, texture…) of various body regions or lesions (e.g. tumors, ischemia, cysts etc) and to monitor disease progression or regression.\n* Kinnunen K. M., et al. \"Volumetric MRI-Based Biomarkers in Huntington's Disease: An Evidentiary Review\", <https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.712555>\n* McCarthy J., et al. \"Morphometric MRI as a diagnostic biomarker of frontotemporal dementia: A systematic review to determine clinical applicability\", <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2018.08.028>\nWhile MR images are typically assessed in a qualitative way, MRI can collect quantitative information about tissue properties. The range of properties includes the magnetic resonance (MR) relaxation times T1 and T2, T2\\*, diffusion, perfusion, fat and water fractions, iron fraction, elastic properties of tissue, temperature, chemical composition, and chemical exchange, just to mention some. Of note, new MRI methods are constantly being developed. By using the sensitivity of MRI to these tissue properties, it is possible to generate quantitative maps instead of qualitative anatomical images, where the intensity of each pixel corresponds to a measurement of one specific physical or physiological property. Quantitative measurements could help not only for identifying anatomical abnormalities but also for detecting initial loss of function or tissue alteration.\n[Use cases](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/content/use-cases/#volumetric)\n**Available at:**\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed - DIMP NEUROMED](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Facility of Multimodal Imaging - AMMI Maastricht (NL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/facility-of-excellence-in-imaging---alm-and-molecular-imaging-node-maastricht)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Medical and Preclinical Imaging Hungary (HU)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Preclinical Imaging Centre (PRIME) - Molecular Imaging Dutch Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node)\n* [NORMOLIM, Norwegian Molecular Imaging Infrastructure](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Medical and Preclinicial Imaging Hungary](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n## Relaxation mapping - T1, T2, T2\\*, spin-lock MR techniques\nThe signal intensity in  MR images is  a function of water content, tissue properties and of MRI acquisition parameters.\nFor quantitative MR imaging, tissue relaxation times are measured by extracting the signal exponential decay (T2 or T2\\*) or recovery (T1) from multiple measurements.  T1, T2 and/or T1rho parametric images can be acquired.\nThe quantification of relaxation times provides more detailed information on the tissue characteristics (tumor cells invasion, ischemic lesions, vascular leakage, iron deposition, inflammation etc), thus supporting the clinicians in the diagnostic process. Furthermore, relaxation maps are used to quantitatively assess the presence of exogenous contrast agents.\nExample applications:\n* Evaluation of the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix in cartilage (T.J. Moshet et al., “Cartilage MRI T2 Relaxation Time Mapping: Overview and Applications” Seminars in Musculoskeletal Radiology, 2004, 8, 355) and of myocardial pathologies (<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcmg.2013.05.005>).\n* Detection of initial nerve degeneration in ALS (N.

Diffusion imaging is used to obtain important information about water movements within the architecture of tissues. This is achieved by using MRI sequences specifically designed to  measure the values of the water diffusion coefficient (Diffusion Weighted Imaging) and its components along the 3D space (Diffusion Tensor imaging).\nNeither contrast agents nor specific instrumentation are requested for this kind of experiments.\nDiffusion MRI is used to evaluate the molecular function and micro-architecture of tissues, and it acts as a tool for monitoring treatment response and disease progression for a variety of pathologies such as tumors, white matter diseases, inflammatory diseases and so on.

In the first case, dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC)-MRI, which measures the signal loss in T2- or T2\\*-weighted images, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI, which measures the signal loss in T1-weighted images, are used. In the latter case, arterial spin-labeling (ASL) is used.\nWhile ASL is mainly applied for the measurement of cerebral perfusion, DSC and DCE-MRI are used in a wider variety of clinical applications, including the classification of tumors, stroke regions, and characterization of other diseases, as well as for assessing response to antiangiogenic therapies.\n* Boxerman J.L., et al. \"Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast MR Imaging in Glioma: Review of Current Clinical Practice.\" <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2016.06.005>\n* Sujlana, et al. \"Review of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI: Technical aspects and applications in the musculoskeletal system\", <https://doi.org/10.1002/jmri.25810>\nIn neurology, brain perfusion parameters such as Normalized Cerebral Blood Flow (NCBF) and Cerebral Blood Volume (CBV) are relevant hemodynamic parameters, as their changes can precede abnormalities on conventional MR imaging. Thus, knowledge of whether a lesion identified in anatomic images is associated with increased or decreased CBF or CBV can frequently help narrow the differential diagnosis.\n![](upload/asl-mrileft.png)\n![](upload/asl-mriright.png)\nMR images (A) and parameter maps calculated from data of both dynamic susceptibility-contrast MRI (B), and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (C), obtained from a patient with anaplastic astrocytoma in the frontal lobe of the brain.

It is typically based on dynamic measurement of brain with BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent) contrast which is achievable with T2\\* weighted images (e.g. GRE EPI). Other contrast principles can be used as well (e.g. blood perfusion). Typical spatial resolution ranges from 3 x 3 x 3 mm to 2 x 2 x 2 mm in whole brain coverage, or even up to 0.1 mm in limited field of view and at ultra-high fields (7T or more). Temporal resolution ranges from 3 s to 0.5 s with EPI sequence.\nfMRI can be used in medical research (and diagnostics) as well as psychology, neuroeconomy, and other disciplines related to understanding human brain and behavior. It is typically used to measure neural activity during tasks or following to stimuli (e.g. scenario with auditory, visual or tactile stimuli distributed during the acquisition time to induce required brain activity), but resting-state fMRI is possible too. It allows to obtain activation maps, evaluate the hemodynamic response in selected regions, estimate the functional connection among brain regions, and evaluate the relationship between activity/connectivity and external variables.\nfMRI can be combined with electrophysiological recordings or stimulation.\nA special case is fMRI hyperscanning (dual fMRI) with two participants measured simultaneously in two scanners.\nExample applications include:\n* localization of brain functions and networks\n* monitoring brain changes caused by stress\n* discovering brain changes in various diseases (e.g. Alzheimer disease, Schizophrenia etc)\n* understanding empathy, emotions and consciousness\n* understanding the learning process\n* observing brain plasticity, development, aging affects\n**Available at:**\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Medical and Preclinicial Imaging Hungary](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n## Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST), Magnetization Transfer (MT) MRI\nIn CEST imaging, a radiofrequency pulse is applied at the resonant frequency(ies) of exchangeable protons in a given molecule or metabolite, in order to reach a saturation state. Chemical exchange of the protons with those of water molecules causes the transfer of magnetic saturation to water over time. The subsequent decrease in water signal is detected by standard MR imaging sequences and provides an indirect measure of the concentration of the species of interest.\nCEST MRI can detect a variety of endogenous small molecules (e.g. glucose, glycogen, lactate, creatine, glutamate), proteins and enzymes for molecular imaging. Development of exogenous CEST agents, including diamagnetic CEST (DIACEST), paramagnetic CEST (PARACEST) and liposome-based (LIPOCEST) agents, greatly enhanced the sensitivity and specificity of CEST imaging (Longo D.L. et al.; “A snapshot of the vast array of diamagnetic CEST MRI contrast agents” <https://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.4715>; Ferrauto G. et al.; “LipoCEST and cellCEST imaging agents: opportunities and challenges” <https://doi.org/10.1002/wnan.1385>).\nCEST imaging can provide information on tissue pH, temperature, oxygenation, metabolism, enzymatic reactions as well as for molecular imaging applications. Example applications include several disorders such as acute stroke, renal injury, tumors and multiple sclerosis.\n![](upload/chemicalmri.png)\nApplication of MRI-CEST tumor pH imaging for assessing response to novel anticancer therapies.

The MT contrast is different from T1, T2, and PD, and it likely reflects the structural integrity of the tissue being imaged. Applications include tissue characterization, such as evaluation of multiple sclerosis and other white-matter lesions and in tumors.\nSee also: van Zijl PCM et al.; “Magnetization Transfer Contrast and Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer MRI.

Since the molecular concentrations of these metabolites are at least 10.000 times lower than water, they produce correspondingly much lower signal strengths. Thus, to detect enough signal above noise for quantification, 1H-MRSI must use much larger voxel sizes in comparison to MRI, leading to lower spatial resolution with respect to anatomical imaging. The use of high magnetic fields allows to overcome this issue.\nMRSI is used in the clinics for quantifying metabolic abnormalities in the human brain, prostate, breast and other organs.\nSee for example:\n* T.A.A. Boroeders et al., “Glutamate levels across deep brain structures in patients with a psychotic disorder and its relation with cognitive functioning”, [http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2021...](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.01.21250977)\n* A.A.

Nevertheless, technological progress, development of acquisition methods and the availability of equipment operating at high magnetic fields have made in vivo heteronuclear MRI/MRS possible in both humans and small animals despite sensitivity limitation, widening the number of applications and the range of metabolites that can be mapped by MRS.\nSodium (23Na) MRI has been applied in a large variety of biomedical/clinical research areas. Sodium ions (Na+) play an important role in many cellular physiological processes. An unbalanced concentration gradient across the cell membranes or an increase in the intracellular Na+ content is an early marker of cell viability in many disease processes. 23Na-MRI can be used for studying heart diseases, by exploiting the increase in the extracellular sodium signal in acute ischemia, for cancer investigations, by measuring the increase of sodium content in proliferating cells, and for testing therapies by evaluating the intracellular sodium accumulation due to cell death <https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jacr.2007.07.001>).\n31P MRS can be used to study the energetic metabolism of a wide range of tissues such as muscle, heart, liver, and kidney in various pathological contexts. Using the endogenous 31P signal arising from the tissue, it is possible to obtain information about the energy status and also determine the intracellular pH (from the chemical shift of Pi). 31P signals from inorganic phosphate, adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, creatine phosphate and sugar phosphates can be observed in whole-cell preparations, intact tissues or organs. Phosphate metabolites that are involved in ATP production and utilization can be quantified non-invasively by 31P-MRS/MRI, while 31P magnetization transfer (MT) techniques allow in vivo measurement of metabolic fluxes via creatine kinase (CK) and ATP synthase (<https://doi.org/10.21037%2Fqims.2017.11.03>).\nFor 13C-MRI, hyperpolarized probes are usually used in order to increase the sensitivity of the technique (see Hyperpolarized MRI).\n19F MRI is increasingly emerging as a multi-nuclear (1H/19F) technique that can be exploited for several purposes, e.g. cell tracking, detection of active inflammation, measuring tissue oxygenation and to study fluorinated pharmaceuticals. The lack of a 19F background signal in tissues affords an unequivocal detection suitable for quantification. Fluorine-based contrast agents can be engineered as nanoemulsions, nanocapsules, or nanoparticles to label cells in vitro or in vivo. Multispectral 19F-MRI using different fluorinated compounds could be also used to detect different labeled cells simultaneously. Specific fluorinated products can be used to map pO2 heterogeneity in tissues.

This is particularly true for nuclei other than protons. Hyperpolarized probes are molecules where the nuclei polarization has been artificially raised. Conversely to standard MRI contrast agents, which act on the relaxation of water protons, hyperpolarized molecules are themselves the source of the NMR signal, thus yielding to signal intensity and SNR that linearly depend upon their concentration and polarization level. Long relaxation times of the hyperpolarized nuclei are essential in order to preserve the polarization for as long as possible. For this reason HP-MRI relies on the detection of heteronuclei rather than protons. For most applications 13C-probes are used.\nThe use of hyperpolarized probes allows to obtain very strong signal enhancements, thus overcoming the MR sensitivity issue and making the detection of low concentration biological molecules possible. Hyperpolarized probes are usually employed for perfusion studies and for mapping metabolites and their transformations through MRS in the body. Hyperpolarized metabolic imaging is particularly useful for the early diagnosis of cancer and monitoring of treatments efficacy because it can reveal changes that happen well before the onset of macroscopic signs of the disease. A typical example is the monitoring of pyruvate and lactate levels after injection of hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate.\nOther examples of applications in the preclinical and clinical fields can be found in the following reviews:\n* Z.J.

A difference in respect to MRI of other body regions is that cardiac and respiratory motions cause artifacts. Thus, CMR requires synchronous cardiac and respiratory gating or breath-holding techniques. Cardiac synchronization with ECG is often used to “freeze” the hearth during MR acquisition.\nMRI can also be used to record movies of the cardiac cycle that permit the extraction of a good number of dynamic cardiac parameters (cine MRI).\nFor more details on CMR techniques and applications see:\n* W.-Y.I.

The MRS*DRYMAG 7.0T exemplifies this technology, utilizing cryogen-free superconducting dry magnet technology, which eliminates the need for liquid helium cooling. This feature simplifies installation and reduces operational costs, making it highly accessible for research facilities.\n\n**Key Capabilities**  \nMicro-MRI/MRS systems are designed to operate within a magnetic field range of 0.1 T to 7 T, providing high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic capabilities. The MRS*DRYMAG features bore sizes from 17 cm to 42 cm, accommodating various small animal sizes, including mice and rats, with a maximum weight capacity of 12 kg. The systems are equipped with advanced phased array multi-element coils that enhance signal detection and imaging quality. Gradient strengths can reach up to 2000 mT/m, facilitating rapid imaging sequences and improved spatial resolution. The technology supports multi-nuclear imaging, allowing researchers to analyze different elements within biological tissues, which is crucial for metabolic studies.\n\n**Applications**  \nMicro-MRI/MRS is extensively used in preclinical research to investigate neurological disorders, cancer, and metabolic diseases. The high sensitivity of MRS at these field strengths enables the detection of subtle metabolic changes in tissues, providing critical insights into disease mechanisms and treatment responses. Institutions like the Mayo Clinic utilize 7-T MRI to enhance the diagnosis and management of conditions such as epilepsy and multiple sclerosis, showcasing the technology's clinical relevance.\n\n**Advantages**  \nThe primary advantage of micro-MRI/MRS systems operating below 7 T is their operational simplicity and cost-effectiveness compared to higher-field systems. The absence of cryogens reduces logistical burdens and maintenance costs. Additionally, the integration with PET/MR and SPECT/MR imaging capabilities allows for comprehensive assessments of both anatomical and functional parameters in vivo. This versatility makes micro-MRI/MRS an invaluable tool for researchers aiming to explore complex biological processes and improve therapeutic strategies.\n\n## References\n\n1. https://www.mrsolutions.com/mr-imaging/mr-imaging/mr-dry-magnet-cryogen-free/mr-7t/\n2. https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/neurology-neurosurgery/news/7-t-mri-providing-hope-by-seeing-the-previously-unseen/mac-20550624\n\n**AI Enhancement Confidence Score:** 0.95\n",

MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields, radiofrequency pulses, and field gradients to generate images of soft tissues throughout the body.**\nContrast agents based on paramagnetic compounds are commonly used to enhance the signal/noise ratio and assess vascularization or tissue permeability. More recently,  novel classes of contrast agents have been developed, such as hyperpolarized molecules for high sensitivity metabolic studies, or CEST agents for accurate pH parametric imaging.\nMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) can be used to complement MRI in the characterization of tissues. While MRI makes use of water proton signals to create images, MRS uses either proton or heteronuclei signals to determine the relative concentrations of metabolites within a specific organ/tissue.\nMRI scanners at high magnetic fields have the advantage to significantly increase the sensitivity and thus improve the image resolution and scan duration. MRS also benefits from high magnetic fields with an increased spectral resolution, which improves the separation between different chemical components. Nowadays, scanners at 3-7 Tesla are commonly used for both humans and animals, but for small-medium animal studies high field scanners operating at 7-9.4T are also quite common. Ultra-high field MR systems with fields of up to 17 T are also available mainly for preclinical studies.\nIn microMRI/MRS, the instruments are technically optimized for small animal studies, providing resolution in the mm to µm range.\nMRI, either as a single modality or paired to other imaging modalities, is largely used for *in vivo* (humans and animals) studies and also for ex-vivo analysis of specimens (organs or tissue samples).\nIn preclinical imaging, animal models of various pathologies, from tumors to cardiovascular, neurological or metabolic disorders, are commonly used to monitor disease development and to test the efficacy of therapeutic treatments, to develop novel diagnostic tools etc. Several quantitative imaging biomarkers can be used to monitor disease progression over time.\nAnimal imaging can also be used for veterinary studies.\nAt clinical level, MRI is generally a key tool for the diagnosis of various pathologies and for monitoring the efficacy of new therapies. It is also commonly used in studies involving healthy volunteers to evaluate metabolism or functions.\nMRI comprises a large number of techniques for various applications ranging from simple morphological measurements throughout all organs to the evaluation of complex systems, functions, and processes in living organisms.\n**Preclinical and ex-vivo MRI**is provided by the following Nodes:\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed - DIMP NEUROMED](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Facility of Multimodal Imaging - AMMI Maastricht (NL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/facility-of-excellence-in-imaging---alm-and-molecular-imaging-node-maastricht)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Medical and Preclinical Imaging Hungary (HU)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Population Imaging Node Valencia (ES)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/population-imaging-valencia)\n* [Preclinical Imaging Centre (PRIME) - Molecular Imaging Dutch Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node)\n* [NORMOLIM, Norwegian Molecular Imaging Infrastructure](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)\n**Human MRI** is provided by the following Nodes:\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Population Imaging Node Valencia (ES)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/population-imaging-valencia)\n### Use cases\nClick here for\n[Use Cases](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/preclinical-and-medical-imaging-technologies-use-cases-from-our-nodes/) from our Nodes.\n## Anatomical, volumetric, morphometric MRI\nContrast in MRI images is generated by the differences in the nuclear relaxation times of water protons (T1 and T2) across tissues. The image contrast can be controlled by changing the values of specific acquisition parameters, generally the echo time (TE) and the repetition time (TR). Depending on their values, it is possible to obtain images where the contrast and brightness are predominantly determined by the T1 or T2 properties of water in tissues (T1-weighted and T2-weighted images respectively).\nContrast agents are frequently administered to enhance the contrast for assessment of organ functions (perfusion, vascularity, permeability) or better delineation of specific lesions or tissues. Mainly Gd based molecules are used with the acquisition of T1-weighted images and for specific cases iron Oxides could be used with T2-weighted images.\nThe acquisition of anatomical MR images is done with the scope of obtaining detailed morphological information ( shape, size, volume, texture…) of various body regions or lesions (e.g. tumors, ischemia, cysts etc) and to monitor disease progression or regression.\n* Kinnunen K. M., et al. \"Volumetric MRI-Based Biomarkers in Huntington's Disease: An Evidentiary Review\", <https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.712555>\n* McCarthy J., et al. \"Morphometric MRI as a diagnostic biomarker of frontotemporal dementia: A systematic review to determine clinical applicability\", <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2018.08.028>\nWhile MR images are typically assessed in a qualitative way, MRI can collect quantitative information about tissue properties. The range of properties includes the magnetic resonance (MR) relaxation times T1 and T2, T2\\*, diffusion, perfusion, fat and water fractions, iron fraction, elastic properties of tissue, temperature, chemical composition, and chemical exchange, just to mention some. Of note, new MRI methods are constantly being developed. By using the sensitivity of MRI to these tissue properties, it is possible to generate quantitative maps instead of qualitative anatomical images, where the intensity of each pixel corresponds to a measurement of one specific physical or physiological property. Quantitative measurements could help not only for identifying anatomical abnormalities but also for detecting initial loss of function or tissue alteration.\n[Use cases](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/content/use-cases/#volumetric)\n**Available at:**\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed - DIMP NEUROMED](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Facility of Multimodal Imaging - AMMI Maastricht (NL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/facility-of-excellence-in-imaging---alm-and-molecular-imaging-node-maastricht)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Medical and Preclinical Imaging Hungary (HU)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Preclinical Imaging Centre (PRIME) - Molecular Imaging Dutch Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node)\n* [NORMOLIM, Norwegian Molecular Imaging Infrastructure](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Medical and Preclinicial Imaging Hungary](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n## Relaxation mapping - T1, T2, T2\\*, spin-lock MR techniques\nThe signal intensity in  MR images is  a function of water content, tissue properties and of MRI acquisition parameters.\nFor quantitative MR imaging, tissue relaxation times are measured by extracting the signal exponential decay (T2 or T2\\*) or recovery (T1) from multiple measurements.  T1, T2 and/or T1rho parametric images can be acquired.\nThe quantification of relaxation times provides more detailed information on the tissue characteristics (tumor cells invasion, ischemic lesions, vascular leakage, iron deposition, inflammation etc), thus supporting the clinicians in the diagnostic process.

Diffusion imaging is used to obtain important information about water movements within the architecture of tissues. This is achieved by using MRI sequences specifically designed to  measure the values of the water diffusion coefficient (Diffusion Weighted Imaging) and its components along the 3D space (Diffusion Tensor imaging).\nNeither contrast agents nor specific instrumentation are requested for this kind of experiments.\nDiffusion MRI is used to evaluate the molecular function and micro-architecture of tissues, and it acts as a tool for monitoring treatment response and disease progression for a variety of pathologies such as tumors, white matter diseases, inflammatory diseases and so on.

In the first case, dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC)-MRI, which measures the signal loss in T2- or T2\\*-weighted images, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI, which measures the signal loss in T1-weighted images, are used. In the latter case, arterial spin-labeling (ASL) is used.\nWhile ASL is mainly applied for the measurement of cerebral perfusion, DSC and DCE-MRI are used in a wider variety of clinical applications, including the classification of tumors, stroke regions, and characterization of other diseases, as well as for assessing response to antiangiogenic therapies.\n* Boxerman J.L., et al. \"Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast MR Imaging in Glioma: Review of Current Clinical Practice.\" <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2016.06.005>\n* Sujlana, et al. \"Review of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI: Technical aspects and applications in the musculoskeletal system\", <https://doi.org/10.1002/jmri.25810>\nIn neurology, brain perfusion parameters such as Normalized Cerebral Blood Flow (NCBF) and Cerebral Blood Volume (CBV) are relevant hemodynamic parameters, as their changes can precede abnormalities on conventional MR imaging.

It is typically based on dynamic measurement of brain with BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent) contrast which is achievable with T2\\* weighted images (e.g. GRE EPI). Other contrast principles can be used as well (e.g. blood perfusion). Typical spatial resolution ranges from 3 x 3 x 3 mm to 2 x 2 x 2 mm in whole brain coverage, or even up to 0.1 mm in limited field of view and at ultra-high fields (7T or more). Temporal resolution ranges from 3 s to 0.5 s with EPI sequence.\nfMRI can be used in medical research (and diagnostics) as well as psychology, neuroeconomy, and other disciplines related to understanding human brain and behavior. It is typically used to measure neural activity during tasks or following to stimuli (e.g. scenario with auditory, visual or tactile stimuli distributed during the acquisition time to induce required brain activity), but resting-state fMRI is possible too. It allows to obtain activation maps, evaluate the hemodynamic response in selected regions, estimate the functional connection among brain regions, and evaluate the relationship between activity/connectivity and external variables.\nfMRI can be combined with electrophysiological recordings or stimulation.\nA special case is fMRI hyperscanning (dual fMRI) with two participants measured simultaneously in two scanners.\nExample applications include:\n* localization of brain functions and networks\n* monitoring brain changes caused by stress\n* discovering brain changes in various diseases (e.g. Alzheimer disease, Schizophrenia etc)\n* understanding empathy, emotions and consciousness\n* understanding the learning process\n* observing brain plasticity, development, aging affects\n**Available at:**\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Medical and Preclinicial Imaging Hungary](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n## Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST), Magnetization Transfer (MT) MRI\nIn CEST imaging, a radiofrequency pulse is applied at the resonant frequency(ies) of exchangeable protons in a given molecule or metabolite, in order to reach a saturation state. Chemical exchange of the protons with those of water molecules causes the transfer of magnetic saturation to water over time. The subsequent decrease in water signal is detected by standard MR imaging sequences and provides an indirect measure of the concentration of the species of interest.\nCEST MRI can detect a variety of endogenous small molecules (e.g. glucose, glycogen, lactate, creatine, glutamate), proteins and enzymes for molecular imaging. Development of exogenous CEST agents, including diamagnetic CEST (DIACEST), paramagnetic CEST (PARACEST) and liposome-based (LIPOCEST) agents, greatly enhanced the sensitivity and specificity of CEST imaging (Longo D.L. et al.; “A snapshot of the vast array of diamagnetic CEST MRI contrast agents” <https://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.4715>; Ferrauto G. et al.; “LipoCEST and cellCEST imaging agents: opportunities and challenges” <https://doi.org/10.1002/wnan.1385>).\nCEST imaging can provide information on tissue pH, temperature, oxygenation, metabolism, enzymatic reactions as well as for molecular imaging applications. Example applications include several disorders such as acute stroke, renal injury, tumors and multiple sclerosis.\n![](upload/chemicalmri.png)\nApplication of MRI-CEST tumor pH imaging for assessing response to novel anticancer therapies.

The MT contrast is different from T1, T2, and PD, and it likely reflects the structural integrity of the tissue being imaged. Applications include tissue characterization, such as evaluation of multiple sclerosis and other white-matter lesions and in tumors.\nSee also: van Zijl PCM et al.; “Magnetization Transfer Contrast and Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer MRI.

Since the molecular concentrations of these metabolites are at least 10.000 times lower than water, they produce correspondingly much lower signal strengths. Thus, to detect enough signal above noise for quantification, 1H-MRSI must use much larger voxel sizes in comparison to MRI, leading to lower spatial resolution with respect to anatomical imaging. The use of high magnetic fields allows to overcome this issue.\nMRSI is used in the clinics for quantifying metabolic abnormalities in the human brain, prostate, breast and other organs.\nSee for example:\n* T.A.A. Boroeders et al., “Glutamate levels across deep brain structures in patients with a psychotic disorder and its relation with cognitive functioning”, [http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2021...](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.01.21250977)\n* A.A.

Nevertheless, technological progress, development of acquisition methods and the availability of equipment operating at high magnetic fields have made in vivo heteronuclear MRI/MRS possible in both humans and small animals despite sensitivity limitation, widening the number of applications and the range of metabolites that can be mapped by MRS.\nSodium (23Na) MRI has been applied in a large variety of biomedical/clinical research areas. Sodium ions (Na+) play an important role in many cellular physiological processes. An unbalanced concentration gradient across the cell membranes or an increase in the intracellular Na+ content is an early marker of cell viability in many disease processes. 23Na-MRI can be used for studying heart diseases, by exploiting the increase in the extracellular sodium signal in acute ischemia, for cancer investigations, by measuring the increase of sodium content in proliferating cells, and for testing therapies by evaluating the intracellular sodium accumulation due to cell death <https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jacr.2007.07.001>).\n31P MRS can be used to study the energetic metabolism of a wide range of tissues such as muscle, heart, liver, and kidney in various pathological contexts. Using the endogenous 31P signal arising from the tissue, it is possible to obtain information about the energy status and also determine the intracellular pH (from the chemical shift of Pi). 31P signals from inorganic phosphate, adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, creatine phosphate and sugar phosphates can be observed in whole-cell preparations, intact tissues or organs. Phosphate metabolites that are involved in ATP production and utilization can be quantified non-invasively by 31P-MRS/MRI, while 31P magnetization transfer (MT) techniques allow in vivo measurement of metabolic fluxes via creatine kinase (CK) and ATP synthase (<https://doi.org/10.21037%2Fqims.2017.11.03>).\nFor 13C-MRI, hyperpolarized probes are usually used in order to increase the sensitivity of the technique (see Hyperpolarized MRI).\n19F MRI is increasingly emerging as a multi-nuclear (1H/19F) technique that can be exploited for several purposes, e.g. cell tracking, detection of active inflammation, measuring tissue oxygenation and to study fluorinated pharmaceuticals. The lack of a 19F background signal in tissues affords an unequivocal detection suitable for quantification. Fluorine-based contrast agents can be engineered as nanoemulsions, nanocapsules, or nanoparticles to label cells in vitro or in vivo. Multispectral 19F-MRI using different fluorinated compounds could be also used to detect different labeled cells simultaneously. Specific fluorinated products can be used to map pO2 heterogeneity in tissues.

This is particularly true for nuclei other than protons. Hyperpolarized probes are molecules where the nuclei polarization has been artificially raised. Conversely to standard MRI contrast agents, which act on the relaxation of water protons, hyperpolarized molecules are themselves the source of the NMR signal, thus yielding to signal intensity and SNR that linearly depend upon their concentration and polarization level. Long relaxation times of the hyperpolarized nuclei are essential in order to preserve the polarization for as long as possible. For this reason HP-MRI relies on the detection of heteronuclei rather than protons. For most applications 13C-probes are used.\nThe use of hyperpolarized probes allows to obtain very strong signal enhancements, thus overcoming the MR sensitivity issue and making the detection of low concentration biological molecules possible. Hyperpolarized probes are usually employed for perfusion studies and for mapping metabolites and their transformations through MRS in the body. Hyperpolarized metabolic imaging is particularly useful for the early diagnosis of cancer and monitoring of treatments efficacy because it can reveal changes that happen well before the onset of macroscopic signs of the disease. A typical example is the monitoring of pyruvate and lactate levels after injection of hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate.\nOther examples of applications in the preclinical and clinical fields can be found in the following reviews:\n* Z.J.

A difference in respect to MRI of other body regions is that cardiac and respiratory motions cause artifacts. Thus, CMR requires synchronous cardiac and respiratory gating or breath-holding techniques. Cardiac synchronization with ECG is often used to “freeze” the hearth during MR acquisition.\nMRI can also be used to record movies of the cardiac cycle that permit the extraction of a good number of dynamic cardiac parameters (cine MRI).\nFor more details on CMR techniques and applications see:\n* W.-Y.I.

      "documentation": "## Nuclear medicine: PET, PET/CT, SPECT, SPECT/CT\n---\n**Nuclear Medicine is the field dedicated to the imaging of short-lived radiolabelled compounds injected into the body, and is thus true ‘molecular imaging’. Due to its exquisite sensitivity, very low amounts of compounds that bind to cellular targets (radioligands) or are substrates for biological processes (radiotracers) can be detected, providing quantitative information about the rate of biological processes or number of receptors within organs and tissues without altering the underlying biology (the ‘tracer’ principle). Nuclear medicine makes use of two major modalities depending on the type of radioisotope used for radiolabelling, namely PET (Positron Emission Tomography) and SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography).**\nPET and SPECT imaging can be performed as single modality acquisition but are more often used in combination with CT (PET-CT, SPECT-CT) or [MRI (PET-MRI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/service/MRI-PET), which allow for precise spatial localization of the PET/SPECT signals within the body.\n\n## AI Generated Documentation\n\n**Overview**  \nMicro-SPECT-CT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography-Computed Tomography) is a cutting-edge imaging technology that merges the functional imaging capabilities of SPECT with the anatomical detail provided by CT. This hybrid modality is particularly suited for preclinical research, enabling in vivo visualization of biological processes in small animal models with high precision and sensitivity.  \n\n**Key Capabilities**  \nMicro-SPECT-CT systems, such as the Mediso nanoScan® SPECT/CT, achieve spatial resolutions down to 0.3 mm, making them capable of detecting minute biological changes. The technology employs advanced multi-pinhole collimators that optimize imaging performance for various applications, ranging from whole-body scans to focused imaging of small animals like mice and rats. The systems utilize thick sodium iodide (NaI:Tl) crystals (9.5 mm) for enhanced sensitivity, particularly for high-energy isotopes. Additionally, the Tera-Tomo™ 3D SPECT reconstruction algorithm provides absolute quantitative imaging through real-time Monte Carlo simulations, allowing for precise assessment of radiotracer distribution.  \n\n**Applications**  \nMicro-SPECT-CT is extensively utilized in biomedical research, particularly in the following areas:  \n- **Oncology**: Imaging metabolic processes and receptor binding in tumors, facilitating the assessment of tumor biology and treatment responses.  \n- **Pharmacokinetics**: Evaluating drug distribution and efficacy in preclinical trials, essential for drug development.  \n- **Cardiovascular and Neurological Studies**: Monitoring disease progression and therapeutic interventions in heart and brain disorders.  \n- **Gene Expression Studies**: Investigating cellular processes and gene therapy effects in live subjects.  \n\n**Advantages**  \nThe integration of SPECT and CT in a single platform offers several distinct advantages:  \n- **Enhanced Diagnostic Accuracy**: The combination of functional and anatomical data improves localization and characterization of lesions.  \n- **High Sensitivity and Resolution**: The ability to detect small lesions and subtle biological changes is critical for early diagnosis and treatment monitoring.  \n- **Dynamic Imaging Capability**: The system allows for rapid acquisition of data without gantry or table motion, which is essential for time-sensitive studies.  \n\nIn summary, micro-SPECT-CT stands out in the field of preclinical imaging by providing a powerful tool for researchers to explore complex biological systems and improve therapeutic strategies through its high-resolution, quantitative imaging capabilities.\n\n## References\n\n1. https://mediso.com/global/en/product/pre-clinical-products/nanoscanr-spectct\n2. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11241697/\n3. https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-65850-2\n\n**AI Enhancement Confidence Score:** 0.95\n",

      "documentation": "## Ultrasound Imaging (US)\n---\nUltraSound Imaging (US) relies on the use of Ultrasound. Ultrasonic images are created by sending pulses of ultrasound into tissues and recording echoes, which are reflected to a different extent by different tissues.\nIn microUS, the instrumentation is implemented with accessories or with a technical set-up which provide optimum resolution and sensitivity for small animal studies.\nThe resolution range of US depends on which transducer is used. The higher transducer resolution, the higher the frequency, but the smaller the FOV. By choosing the right transducer it is thus possible to optimize US resolution and sensitivity for a specific organ or other tissue.\nUS imaging is particularly suitable to visualize soft tissues such as muscles, tendons, organs etc and for cardiovascular studies.\nSpecific US techniques and example applications of US imaging can be found  in the following articles:\n* C.M.

In 2D B-Mode US images the organs and tissues of\ninterest are depicted as dots of variable brightness, depending on the\namplitude of the returned echo signal.\n3D preclinical ultrasound images are generated by the acquisition of\nconsecutive B-mode ultrasound images acquired at discrete step sizes\nalong a predetermined path. Commercial software then reconstructs the\n3D volume.\nUsing High Frequency UltraSound (HFUS, frequency higher than 10MHz)\nallows to obtain very high resolution images (e.g. up to the\nmicroscopic scale in preclinical imaging).\nB-mode US imaging is widely used for visualizing and quantifying\nanatomical structures, such as for example organs, lesions, cysts or\ntumors as well as for the visualization of cardiac and vascular\nmovement across the cardiac cycle. Complete 3D acquisitions are\npossible over a cardiac cycle (4D) enabling the dynamic movement of\nthe heart to be viewed from any orientation.\n![](upload/Bmode.png)\n2D B-mode image of a rat heart in diastole, from [https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2...](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2020.00124)\nB-Mode US imaging is also used for needle placement during injection or aspiration\nprocedures.\n![](upload/needle.png)\nNeedle localization by HFUS.

A single line is selected in the B-mode image\nintersecting the chamber walls or valves of interest and ultrasound data is acquired only\nalong the pre-selected M-mode line. Consequently data is acquired with high temporal\nresolution, as only one line of data is acquired rather than 128 lines of data in a full\nB-mode image. The M-mode data is displayed as a continuous function of time scrolling across\nthe screen with depth on the y-axis and time on the x-axis.\nSee for example: Zhou YQ et al. “Comprehensive transthoracic cardiac imaging in mice using\nultrasound biomicroscopy with anatomical confirmation by magnetic resonance imaging”<https://doi.org/10.1152/physiolgenomics.00026.2004>.\n![](upload/mmode.png)\nM-Mode US imaging of the right ventricle with wall thickness measurements.\nCourtesy from Visualsonics\n**Available at:**\n* ****[Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)****\n* ****[NORMOLIM](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)****\n****## Color Doppler, Power Doppler (2D, 3D) US\nDoppler techniques are used to measure blood flow based on the Doppler principle: the\nfrequencies of transmitted and received US beams are different and the difference depends\non the velocity of the scattering red blood cells along the blood flow direction, on the\nUS beam frequency and on the angle between the US beam and the flow direction.\nUsing Color Doppler Mode, flow velocities within vessels are color-coded and the color\nintensity is a function of velocity. Blood moving away from the transducer (larger\nwavelength, i.e. red-shift) is usually encoded in shades of blue while blood moving toward\nthe transducer (shorter wavelength, i.e. blue-shift)  is encoded in shades of\nred.\nColor Doppler provides a visual overview of the flow within the vessels or in the heart,\nprovides an assessment of the flow direction and velocity and, when combined with 3D mode,\nallows to quantify the volume and percent of vascularity.\nIn Power Doppler mode the Doppler signal is displayed as a function of time within a\npre-selected region of interest. In this case, no directional information on blood flow is\nobtained but power Doppler is useful in the detection of small vessels containing slower\nblood flow and it allows to evaluate the percent vascularity.  Changes in vascularity\ncan be informative on the progression and regression of pathologies or on the response to\ntherapy.\n![](upload/colorus.png)\nPower Doppler image of mouse testes, from [https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2...](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2020.00124)\n**Available at:**\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI) (CZ)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [NORMOLIM](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)\n## Pulsed Wave Doppler US\nIn Pulsed Wave (PW) Doppler US, short and quick pulses of sound are sent and reflected\nsound waves between the pulses are analyzed. In respect to continuous Doppler techniques,\nPW Doppler US has the advantage of providing an accurate measure  of the blood\nvelocity in a precise location and in real time.\nPW Doppler can measure velocity of diastolic function, right ventricular function, renal\nartery resistive index and pulsatility index or abdominal aortic velocities.\n**Available at:**\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI) (CZ)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n## Non-Linear Contrast Mode US\nNonlinear Contrast Imaging is performed by intravenously injecting microbubbles, which on\nthe opposite of tissues which typically react linearly to ultrasound energy, react in a\nnon-linear way to the same energy (S. Unnikrishnan et al. “Microbubbles as Ultrasound\nContrast Agents for Molecular Imaging: Preparation and Application”, <https://doi.org/10.2214/AJR.12.8826>).\nThus, after removing or canceling the linear component of the backscattered signal, the\nincrease in non-linear signal as a function of time allows the evaluation of the kinetics\nand dynamic enhancement of organs. Non-targeted microbubbles allow to visualize and\nquantify blood perfusion within an organ or tissue of interest in 2D or 3D.

This technology is particularly significant in the field of urology, specifically for the diagnosis and management of prostate cancer (PCa). Micro-US distinguishes itself from traditional ultrasound and other imaging modalities through its ability to detect tissue alterations as small as 100 microns, enabling precise visualization of pathological changes.  \n\n**Key Capabilities**  \nMicro-US systems are designed to integrate seamlessly with multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) data, enhancing the diagnostic workflow and improving the targeting accuracy for biopsy procedures. The imaging process is facilitated by a standardized risk assessment scale known as PRI-MUS, which categorizes findings based on their likelihood of malignancy. This integration allows clinicians to make informed decisions based on comprehensive imaging data. The technology supports both transrectal and transperineal biopsy techniques, making it versatile for various clinical applications.  \n\n**Applications**  \nThe primary application of micro-US is in the diagnosis and characterization of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). Research has shown that micro-US offers detection rates comparable to mpMRI, making it a valuable tool for both initial diagnosis and active surveillance protocols. It is particularly useful in guiding reclassification biopsies, optimizing treatment decisions, and staging prostate cancer by identifying extraprostatic extension. The technology's real-time imaging capability allows for immediate assessment during procedures, enhancing clinical outcomes.  \n\n**Advantages**  \nMicro-US offers several advantages over traditional imaging modalities. Its high sensitivity and negative predictive value are critical for effective patient management. The non-invasive nature of the technology, combined with its cost-effectiveness compared to other imaging techniques, makes it accessible for widespread clinical use. Furthermore, ongoing advancements, including potential integration with artificial intelligence, promise to enhance the diagnostic accuracy and overall utility of micro-US in clinical practice. In summary, micro-ultrasound represents a significant advancement in biomedical imaging, particularly for prostate cancer management, offering high-resolution imaging, integration with existing diagnostic modalities, and a robust framework for clinical decision-making.\n\n## References\n\n1. https://www.marsbioimaging.com/\n2. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9691355/\n3. https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-78135-3_61\n\n**AI Enhancement Confidence Score:** 0.95\n",

The light microscopy and medical imaging units organize special programs for training scientists in biological and medical imaging techniques and data analysis.**\n### Specialties and expertise of the Node\nThe Euro-BioImaging Node in Brno consists of two parts. The **Medical Imaging** part is formed by two closely collaborating facilities. One is focused on animal ultra-high field MR imaging and spectroscopy (9.4T), the other on human MR imaging (3T) accompanied with electrophysiological techniques. Together, these facilities enable translational research and offer a complex portfolio of MRI techniques including multimodal approaches (e.g. simultaneous EEG-fMRI) and human hyper-scanning (fMRI with two participants measured simultaneously in two scanners). The **Advanced Light Microscopy** part is organized as a central core facility Cellular Imaging (CELLIM) and several closely cooperating laboratories offering together access to equipment, training and image analysis tools. The light microscopy is further specialized in imaging of plant systems, mammalian germs cells, stem cells and embryos, and development of image analysis tools.\nThe Experimental Biophotonics Facility of this Node offers user access to their Q-Phase Multimodal Holographic Microscope developed in-house and commercialized by Tescan / Telight. The microscope provides highly quantitative and rapid measurements of cell behavior, mainly growth and motility, with unprecedented accuracy where the distribution of dry mass inside cells is determined with standard deviation of 0.4 pg/µm2. The microscopy is an implementation of Quantitative Phase Imaging where the dynamic morphometry with live cells in tissue culture is a label free technique and the accuracy is achieved by using an incoherent light source, which also uniquely allows quantitative imaging of cells in 3D environments such as collagen matrix. Integrated fluorescence imaging is available for automated time-lapse with alternating phase imaging and overlaid images are available for examination.\n###\n###\n![](/upload/CELLIM_2.png)\n### Offered Technologies:\n| Technologies | Euro-BioImaging |\n| --- | --- |\n| Deconvolution widefield microscopy (DWM) | ✓ |\n| Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM/CLSM) | ✓ |\n| Spinning disk confocal microscopy (SDCM) | ✓ |\n| Structured illumination microscopy (SIM)\\* | ✓ |\n| Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF) | ✓ |\n| Image Scanning microscopy (ISM) | ✓ |\n| Single Molecula localisation microscopy (SMLM) | ✓ |\n| Light-sheet mesoscopic imaging (SPIM or dSLSM) | ✓ |\n| Quantitative Phase Imaging\\* (QPI) | ✓ |\n| Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) | ✓ |\n| Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) | ✓ |\n| Expansion Microscopy \\* | ✓ |\n| Tissue Clearing \\* | ✓ |\n| micro-MRI/MRS (>= 7T) | ✓ |\n| micro-MRI/MRS (>=7T) - ex-vivo | ✓ |\n| Human MRI/MRS (< 7T) | ✓ |\n| Image Analysis-bio \\* | ✓ |\n| Image Analysis-med \\* | ✓ |\n###\n![](/upload/CELLIM_4.jpg)\n###\n### Instrument highlights\nThe Brno Node is equipped with two 3T Siemens Prisma scanners for human medical imaging. These scanners are designed specifically for high quality research data based on features like strong gradient fields, excellent homogeneity of mg. field and excitation, high sensitivity with 64 channel head/neck coils. Simultaneous use of two scanners enables a relatively unique feature of hyper-scanning (dual fMRI). The human MR scanners are accompanied with several MR compatible electrophysiological devices for recording of high-density EEG, ECG, breathing, skin conductance, etc.\nThe Node also offers extensive image analysis services including tailor-made software development.\nBesides providing access to a wide selection of equipment and analysis tools, the light microscopy unit specializes in plant in vivo imaging and techniques useful for research on live mammalian cells, mammalian germ cells, stem cells and embryos. The light microscopy unit CELLIM recently expanded to include a new SIM/SMLM system from Carl Zeiss, the Elyra 7 – Lattice SIM. This instrument provides several imaging modalities, like structural illumination microscopy (SIM), total internal reflection microscopy (TIRF) and single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), which allows for a wide range of applications.\n###\n![](/upload/MAFIL_MR_scanner.jpg)\n###\n### Contact details\n**Michal Mikl**\nHead of the Node\nRepresentative of medical imaging within node\n[michal.mikl@ceitec.muni.cz](mailto:michal.mikl@ceitec.muni.cz)\n+00420549496099\n**Milan Esner**\nDeputy head of the Node\nRepresentative of microscopic imaging within node\n[milan.esner@ceitec.muni.cz](mailto:milan.esner@ceitec.muni.cz)\n3D view of Multimodal and Functional Imaging Laboratory:\n<http://www.ceitec-muni-neuroscience.pano3d.cz>",

The Node is also active in organizing training and courses focused on theoretical and practical aspects of basic and advanced microscopy techniques. Light microscopy instrumentation includes microscopy systems that range from multi-functional point and spinning disc confocal microscopes, light-sheet and intravital systems, up to high-end multi-photon and super-resolution microscopy systems. In the area of electron microscopy, the Node provides expertise and cutting-edge equipment for a broad range of biological sample preparation and ultrastructural imaging techniques, including some cryo techniques, a complete set of volume EM methods (electron tomography, FIB-SEM, SBF-SEM, AT), EDS elemental analysis and CLEM. Broad expertise in experiment design and data acquisition is also complemented by extensive data analysis services.**\n### Specialties and expertise of the Node\nThe main strength is the wide and deep expertise covering most of light and electron microscopy biological applications, allowed by the complementary nature of collaborating core facilities and more than 25 FTE of expert staff operating more than 50 advanced microscopy systems. In super-resolution imaging all main approaches are covered, including STED, SIM and SMLM, by multiple commercial systems from different manufacturers. Information about molecular dynamics and interactions can be obtained by functional imaging, particularly from spatial-temporal correlation analysis (point, line and image F(C)CS), FRAP, photoactivation, FRET, FLIM or PLIM. Label-free imaging profits from non-linear processes induced by femtosecond NIR lasers and offers methods like SHG, THG, autofluorescence FLIM including metabolic imaging and CARS not only for lipid droplets visualization. Innovative low-toxicity label-free imaging is offered by quantitative phase imaging (QPI). Plants growing in their natural gravity conditions can be directly visualized on the vertical microscope stage of CZ LSM880 with Airyscan. Fast 3D acquisitions are covered by spinning disc and light-sheet systems. In the light intravital microscopy (IVM), the node offers a complete package of services: advanced 2-photon imaging systems, infrastructure for the care and management of small rodents and assistance with surgeries. In electron microscopy the Node offers complete workflow from sample preparation (room temperature or cryo- methods, immunolocalization) through various imaging modalities (TEM, SEM, SBF-SEM, FIB-SEM, array tomography, STEM-EDS elemental analysis) to data analysis (clustering and colocalization in immunolabeling, 3D visualizations). Targeted CLEM workflows allow 3D ultrastructural imaging of rare structures. Data analysis ranges from commercial software packages (Imaris, Huygens, Amira, NIS-Elements and many more) via custom modified routines for image processing and analysis (for example image reconstruction, registration and semi-automatic and AI assisted segmentations, volume reconstruction and 3D visualization, tracking, colocalization analysis, mathematical modeling and analysis of photokinetic experiments, and more) to new software and modules development in the field of stereology and spatial statistics, FLIM and FCS methods.\n### Offered Technologies:\n*[ISIDORe](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/content/isidore) is a Horizon Europe funded project that brings together 154 partners from 32 countries around the world, and is designed to effectively support research on infectious diseases and increase preparedness for pandemic.*\n| Technologies | Euro-BioImaging | ISIDORe |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Deconvolution widefield microscopy (DWM) | ✓ | ✓ |\n| Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM/CLSM) | ✓ | ✓ |\n| Spinning disk confocal microscopy (SDCM) | ✓ | ✓ |\n| Structured illumination microscopy (SIM)\\* | ✓ | ✓ |\n| Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF) | ✓ | ✓ |\n| Two-photon microscopy (2P) | ✓ | ✓ |\n| cryoFM \\* | ✓ | ✓ |\n| Image Scanning microscopy (ISM) | ✓ | ✓ |\n| Single Molecula localisation microscopy (SMLM) | ✓ | ✓ |\n| Stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED) | ✓ | ✓ |\n| Single Particle Tracking (SPT) | ✓ | -

      "documentation": "## SPAIN\n## Barcelona Mesoscopic Imaging Node (BMIN)\n---\n**BMIN is a multi-sited, single-technology Flagship EuroBioimaging Node, with two access sites located in the area of Barcelona, at IRB Barcelona (Institute for Research in Biomedicine) and ICFO (Institute of Photonics Science). It offers open access to a wide range of mesoscopic imaging modalities, mostly based on ***Lightsheet Fluorescence Microscopy (LSFM)*** customized and unique instrumentation, for multiscale optical imaging spanning from 50µm to over 5 cm samples size. BMIN applications include the observation of living organisms, at fast imaging pace, great depth and “all around” (e.g. multiview), or imaging whole organs and organisms in toto with cellular resolution.**\n### Specialties and expertise of the Node\nThe imaging modalities are centrally devoted to multimodal **lightsheet imaging** (e.g. SPIM, DSLM, ASLM, iSPIM, OPM, “scattered” sLS, and more), which can be also combined with other complementary technologies for correlative workflows. BMIN aims to provide life scientists in the public and private sectors with full imaging workflows, including project’s definition and supervision, sample preparation, image data acquisition, bioimage analysis and visualization, and temporary data storage.\nLSFM enables either fast, gentle and/or large volume imaging with samples ranging from mid-sized organoids/spheroids up to embryos or entire organisms. Both living samples and fixed tissues can be imaged under LSFM with great benefits compared to conventional point-scanning 3D imaging techniques (e.g. confocal). At BMIN, seven custom instruments are designed to enhance specific imaging features or performance tailored to either the samples’ size or its longevity. Our strength stands in our ability to pick, or develop/adapt, the optical configuration that best suits the biological question, and in cases to tackle multiscale imaging with the combined use of several instruments.\nHere below, we review the features and advantages of the Lightsheet variants implemented at the Node’s instruments.\n![](upload/Lightsheet_imaging_Live_in_Zebrafish.png)\n**Lightsheet imaging, Live in Zebrafish**. Top Left: larva, head and trunk imaged at 2 angles. Macrophages movements in tail fin (Top Right) and head (Center): color scale shows time projection tracks. Bottom: Zebrafish embryo at different time points across epiboly.\nLightsheet (LS) variants and features available for multimodal live imaging.\n“**SPIM**”: Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy. With a static LS illumination, SPIM enables deep, fast and gentle imaging. Commonly set with a horizontal detection arm and vertical ligthsheet illumination, it offers the simplest and most flexible readout for samples hanging from the top or disposed in a cuvette or chamber.\n**Multiview SPIM**: Most instruments enable sample rotation, hence enabling one to access the sample from the best angle, or to generate a more homogeneous and more isotropic 3D volume in large samples after multiview reconstruction.\n**Double-sided illumination:**\nFor large samples, two lightsheets are used, e.g. from “right” and from “left”, and can be combined to improve the image quality over large fields of view\n**Double-sided detection:** Imaging large samples from both sides simultaneously enables sharper images with large samples. With live samples it results in faster imaging (no rotation), with cleared samples it extends the size of the sample that can be imaged.\n**DSLM:** *Digitally Scanned Lightsheet Microscopy.* The lightsheet is produced by a rapidly scanned beam (in one direction only) to form a LS that yields improved image contrast, quality and resolution. Especially suited to work in the two-photon regime.\n**ASLM**: *Axially Swept Lightsheet Microscopy.* While in SPIM, adjusting the LS focus to the field of view brings a known resolution trade-off, ASLM enables one tosweep the LS waist laterally to achieve the best possible axial resolution across the entire (or larger) field of view.\n**iSPIM**: An inverted SPIM. The illumination and detection objective lenses reach the sample from the top (e.g. by dipping). This inverted geometry allows for easy sample mounting in dish-like or chamber-slide sample carriers.\n**Refocused imaging**: This is either a SPIM or DSLM add-on based on active optics that adjusts the image plane across large volume without moving any part. By moving both the lightsheet and the focus optically, rather than the sample mechanically, one achieves fast volumetric imaging of living samples, reaching up to several tens of volumes per second.\n**OPM,** *Oblique Plane Microscopy*: the lightsheet is formed through the same detection lens and the image is reconstituted through an optical assembly downstream of the primary objective lens. Mounted on an inverted microscope, OPM enables to combine the lightsheet benefits with the use of conventional sample carriers (e.g. multiwell plates), hence true high-throughput and long-term live imaging.\n**MacroSPIM with optical clearing:** For large samples in the order of 5-30mm, imaging with cellular resolution in entire organs at variable magnifications (i.e. continuous zoom) ranging from 0.3x to 24x. Illumination and detection from both sides ease the capture of high contrast images in very large volumes. 3D Tiling enables good resolution over large volumes.\n**Diverging LS**: A diverging lightsheet fills a very extended field of view and offers to image exceptionally large sample (5-7cm or beyond) in a single scan. Typically suited to late development (e.g. late chicken embryo) or full organisms.\n**sLS:  Scattered ligthsheet***.*\nA label free modality that captures the elastic scattering of the laser through the sample to reveal specific scatterers, e.g. nanoparticles, different tissues composition or fibers in tissues\n**Sample mounting expertise:** Depending on the instrument and application, we can employ several strategies to mount and image the sample:\n* Embedding in agarose: top-mounted for live imaging or cleared inside the agarose block.\n* In conventional sample carriers: slide, chamber-slide, petri-dish, multiwell-plates.\n* Resting in a custom cuvette\n* Fluidic approach: imaging samples flowing through a tube enables high-throughput imaging, turning a SPIM into a 3D image-based flow cytometer.\n**Optical Clearing expertise****:** a wide range of clearing protocols have been integrated and tested, including solvent-based for efficient clearing (“Murray’s clear” BABB, DISCO family e.g. iDISCO+, including whole-mount immunofluorescence, DeepCLEAR, PEGASOS, FocusClear, ECI, ECI2, etc..) and water-based clearing for the preservation of endogeneously expressed fluorescent proteins (CUBIC, CLARITY, etc..). We have tested a large variety of clearing protocols since 2010 and we are able to define a strategy to find in reasonable time which technique is best suited to the target sample/tissue.\n![](upload/Cleared_organs.png)\n**Cleared organs imaged with lightsheet microscopes:** Top Left: GFP-expressing metastases in Liver (1mm chunk), Top Right: Whole Bladder (7mm diameter) with tumour (blue tumour, grey Autofluorescence) and nanoparticles (scattered lightsheet, orange), Bottom Left: Whole mouse Brain (1.5cm) with Alzheimer plaques (thioflavin staining), Bottom Right: Chicken embryo stage HH39 (5cm beak-to-toe, Autofluorescence surface render).\n**Label free capabilities**: Through cleared tissues, autofluorescence and scattered lightsheet imaging can provide additional and complementary channels for tissue imaging. Using non-fluorescent elastic scattering of the lightsheet illumination, macroscopic structures or exogenous targets (e.g. nanoparticles) can be revealed at very low laser power levels.\n***Large data image analysis****:*The Node develops tools to enable large image data (>TBs) processing of lightsheet data, including tiled images stitching, multiview fusions, live data analysis, cell tracking.\n***Complementary imaging modalities:***\nWhether to check the sample at higher resolution or to perform correlative imaging workflows, the Node offers alternative modalities to be used in combination with lightsheet imaging, including confocal microscopy, non linear microscopy, super resolution microscopy, Raman microscopy histological sectioning and imaging, etc.\n### Offered Technologies\n* Lightsheet Mesoscopic Imaging (SPIM /sDSLM)\n* Tissue Clearing\\*\n* Expansion Microscopy\\*\n* High-Speed Imaging\\*\n* Feedback Microscopy\\*\n* Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM/CSLM)\n* High Throughput Microscopy / High-Content Screening (HTM/HCS)\n* Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIM)\n* Two-Photon microscopy (2P)\n* Second/Third Harmonic Generation\n* Raman Spectroscopy\n* Image analysis -bio (IA-bio)\\*\n### Additional Services offered by the Node\n* Project planning and methodological setup (e.g. design of study protocol and standard operation procedures)\n* Instruments\n* Training in sample preparation and mounting\n* Customization of sample mounting\n* Technical assistance to run instrument\n* Probe preparation\n* Animal facilities (Drosophila)\n* Wet lab space\n* Bioimage Data processing, analysis and visualization facilities\n* Bioimage Data storage\n* Meeting and training seminar rooms\n* Administrative support for housing\n* Training in infrastructure use\n* Training workstations\n* Biological material storage and processing\n* Training in techniques for optical clearing of biological samples\n* Workshop services for mechanical prototyping (metal, 3D printed), electronics\n* Histology services (separate service) for correlative imaging after lightsheet imaging\n### Instrument highlights\n* DSLM with Two-photon (2P) excitation,\n* Multiview SPIM imaging,\n* DSLM with dual sided illumination, ASLM for high resolution across large field of view, and all optical refocusing for fast volumetric imaging,\n* Macro DSLM: DSLM at low magnification for 0.5-1cm cleared tissues,\n* MacroSPIM: SPIM with ASLM at low magnification for 0.5-3cm cleared tissues, dual side illumination dual side collection,\n* LEMOLISH: SPIM at very low magnification for 1-5cm cleared tissues, single-side illumination, dual side collection,\n* SPIM with fluidics sample mounting for High-throughput Imaging\n* SPIM for in vivo imaging and/or with fluidic sample mounting dual side illumination, dual side collection,\n* SPIM for fast volumetric imaging, incorporating electrically tunable lenses or adaptive optics,\n* Scattered Lightsheet label-free imaging available for cleared and living samples,\n* Oblique Plane Microscopy (dOPM): lightsheet *on an inverted microscope* for High-Throughput Live Imaging, dual view.\n![](upload/Classical_SPIM_with_DSLM.png)\nTop, from Left to right: Classical SPIM with DSLM for high resolution imaging, SPIM for multimodal imaging (with double-sided illumination and multiple detection) with fluidics for sample mounting, iSPIM for fast refocused imaging at high resolution, dOPM for high-throughput imaging in multiwell plates (figure adapted from Maioli et al Sci.

      "documentation": "## FINLAND\n## Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node\n---\n**The Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FiBI) is a multi-sited, multimodal Node covering biomedical imaging from mouse to man. The spearhead imaging technologies of the FiBI Node include 1) preclinical and human PET imaging and PET tracer development, 2) preclinical high-field MRI, 3) magnetoencephalography (MEG), and 4) optical intravital imaging, coupled with a broad repository of imaging tracers and probes, numerous animal models from mice to pigs, and diverse stimulation systems for both animals and humans. The key expertise and main research applications focus on major challenges especially in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, neuroscience, and cancer. With wide coverage of imaging modalities and expertise, the FiBI Node provides exceptional opportunities not only for basic research but also for translational research from small animals to larger animals to humans and to the clinic within a single Node.**\nThe Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node operates in close collaboration with the Finnish Advanced Light Microscopy Node. Together, the two Nodes form Euro-BioImaging Finland, which is on the Academy of Finland’s national roadmap for research infrastructures 2021-2024\n### Specialties and expertise of the Node\nThe expertise and the imaging modalities of the FiBI Node enable versatile basic research but also provide unique approaches especially in translational research and drug development. In addition, the research opportunities in the FiBI Node also cover development and validation of new imaging and other health care technologies, new imaging tracers and probes, and new tools for advanced image processing and analysis.\nSpecial features of the FiBI Node’s spearhead technologies are described below.\n##### **SPECIALITIES IN PET IMAGING**\n* Exceptionally broad collection of different PET tracers to study e.g., blood perfusion, glucose and fatty acid metabolism, (neuro)inflammation, and neurotransmission both in animals and humans. Just to mention a few examples, [15O]H2O, [18F]FDG, [18F]FTHA, and [11C]Acetate are among the most frequently asked tracers for cardiovascular and metabolic imaging, [11C]Methionine, [18F]rhPSMA7.3, and [68Ga]DOTANOC for cancer imaging, and [11C]Raclopride, [11C]PBR, [11C]PIB and [11C]UCB-J for neuroimaging. Our PET tracer portfolio is constantly being streamlined with new tracers developed in-house, so don’t hesitate to ask for more information about available options.\n* Numerous validated PET applications for animal and human studies:\n+ Cardiovascular PET specialties include diagnostics, characterization, and monitoring coronary artery disease, heart failure, and inflammatory processes of the cardiovascular system.\n+ Metabolic PET approaches provide various opportunities for studying key pathological processes such as insulin resistance and pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction in obesity, metabolic diseases, and T2 diabetes, and the effects of physical activity/inactivity on tissue specific and whole body metabolism.\n+ PET applications in neuroscience range from neurophysiology of aging brain, pathophysiology of neurogenerative diseases, mapping neuroreceptor systems in health and disease, molecular and functional processes (e.g. neuroinflammation) of different psychiatric and neurological disorders, to neurobiology of human behavior and emotions.\n+ Oncological PET expertise offers opportunities to assess and validate new hybrid imaging methods and image acquisition protocols in cancer diagnostics, and to develop new theranostic approaches for various types of cancers, such as prostate and breast cancer, neuroendocrine and other somatostatin receptor positive tumors, and malignant lymphoma.\n##### **SPECIALITIES IN PRECLINICAL HIGH-FIELD MRI**\n* Body movement tolerant, in-house developed technology for fMRI of awake animals. The technique allows for example diverse genetic, electrical, and pharmacologic manipulations and at the same time overcomes the interfering effects of anesthetics. It is minimally stressful to animals and it can also be combined with various brain stimulation or electrophysiological recordings providing flexible study designs.\n* Hyperpolarized MRI, a non-radioactive method for investigation of dynamic metabolic processes. The Node houses DNP-hyperpolarizer for 13C-labeled probes, such as pyruvate. Hyperpolarization increases MR sensitivity of 13C nuclei over 10000-fold for 1-2 minutes which allows real-time imaging of pathway-specific metabolic processes, where the injected probe is observed separately from its metabolites. Therefore, hyperpolarized MRI has applications in many diseases with altered metabolism including cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and a variety of inflammatory conditions.\n##### **SPECIALITIES IN MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY (MEG)**\n* Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is optimally suited for detecting neuronal dynamics in the cerebral cortex, which has made it a powerful tool in basic neuroscience research. The FiBI Node offers MEG-optimized experimental designs coupled with a wide range of sensory, motor and cognitive stimulus systems. The offered protocols can be used to study for example sensorimotor and proprioceptive brain activity related to body movements, cortical networks in language processing, and neuronal signaling of cognitive functions in health and disease. MEG is routinely combined with other complementary measures of human neurophysiology such as fMRI, EEG, TMS, and eye-tracking as well as with diverse behavioral measures.\n* Unique opportunities for MEG related imaging and neurotechnological development. New types of MEG sensors, hybrid MEG-MR systems, and next-generation MEG stimulator systems and monitoring devices are actively being developed in house.\n##### **SPECIALITIES IN OPTICAL INTRAVITAL IMAGING**\n* Multiphoton, widefield and intrinsic signal optical intravital imaging set-ups for studying e.g. ear skin vasculature, paw skin, brain, lymph node/mammary gland, tumors, and externalized internal organs such as the intestine, liver and spleen, and protocols and adapters for both anesthetized and behaving animals (brain imaging). These techniques can be used to study for example vascular networks, blood flow and leakage, cell tracking, and morphological changes in longitudinal settings. Advanced neuronal set-ups for brain imaging allow for example dynamic imaging of calcium- or voltage-sensitive proteins, micro-anatomic imaging of dendritic spines and mitochondria, and blood oxygenation and blood flow rate imaging. Brain imaging can also be performed in freely moving animals by using in-house developed home-cage device, where the animal can be exposed to cues, perform tasks or interact with other animals and coupled with physiological recordings.\n### New offer of technology\n*[ISIDORe](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/content/isidore) is a Horizon Europe funded project that brings together 154 partners from 32 countries around the world, and is designed to effectively support research on infectious diseases and increase preparedness for pandemic.*\n| Technologies | Euro-BioImaging | ISIDORe |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| micro-MRI/MRS (>= 7T) | ✓ | ✓ |\n| micro-MRI/MRS (< 7T) | ✓ | ✓ |\n| micro-CT | ✓ | ✓ |\n| micro-PET | ✓ | ✓ |\n| micro-US | ✓ | - |\n| in vivo Optical Imaging | ✓ | ✓ |\n| micro-PET/MRI | ✓ | ✓ |\n| micro-PET/CT | ✓ | ✓ |\n| micro-SPECT/CT | ✓ | – |\n| Intravital microscopy (IVM) - Med | ✓ | – |\n| MRI/MRS (>= 7T) | ✓ | – |\n| MRI/MRS (< 7T) | ✓ | ✓ |\n| MRI-PET | ✓ | – |\n| MEG | ✓ | \\_ |\n| PET | ✓ | ✓ |\n| PET/CT \\* | ✓ | ✓ |\n| micro-MRI/MRS (>= 7T) - ex-vivo | ✓ | – |\n| micro-MRI/MRS (< 7T) - ex-vivo | ✓ | – |\n| micro-CT - ex-vivo | ✓ | – |\n### Additional services offered by the Node\n* User-oriented project support with study design and management\n* Synthesis and development of radiotracers and radiopharmaceuticals\n* Various animal models for human diseases (e.g. mouse, rat, rabbit, and pig models)\n* Advanced animal experiment facilities\n* Assistance in patient and subject recruitment\n* Assistance in acquiring ethical permissions\n* Blood and tissue sampling, metabolite analyses, and pharmacokinetic modelling\n* Electrophysiological and behavioral measurements such as electroencephalography (EEG), navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS), and eye tracking\n* Wide variety of behavioural measurements\n* Basic and advanced training for using the equipment\n* Assistance in image processing, data analyses, and interpretation\n* Data storage\n### Instrument highlights\n**PET imaging:** Three whole body PET/CT scanners (GE Discovery MI, GE D690, GE Discovery VCT), human brain/animal PET scanner (CPS HRRT), simultaneous 3T PET/MRI (GE Healthcare Signa), two small animal PET/CT scanners (Siemens Inveon, Raycan), portable animal PET and CT scanners (Molecubes) and small animal PET scanner (Siemens).

      "documentation": "## BELGIUM\n## Flanders Bioimaging Imaging Node\n---\n**Flanders BioImaging is a multi-sited, multi-modality Node that offers a full and complementary portfolio of biological and biomedical imaging techniques and expertise, at scales ranging from the molecular all the way up to human/clinical imaging (“molecule to man”). The node comprises 9 separate imaging facilities spread across 5 sites, all situated within a 70km radius. Whilst each facility is well equipped for imaging in either the biological or biomedical domain, our strategy is to specialise in the particular spearpoint techniques as detailed in the section below.**\nThe Flanders Bioimaging Node itself is funded by the FWO International Research Infrastructure program, in co-ordination with the Department of Economy, Science and Innovation (EWI), whilst the combined available imaging infrastructure from the constituent sites represents more than €50mi investment.\n### Specialties and expertise of the Node\nFlanders Bioimaging aims to help develop projects for a wide range of users from academia and industry to understand disease at the molecular, cellular, organ and organism levels, and to help develop and validate biomarker tools to help guide drug development and precision medicine. Whilst our sites have broad expertise, there is an especial focus on the oncology and neurodegenerative disease settings.\nOur strategy is to focus on providing access to the leading applications (‘spearpoints’) that have been developed at each site – each spearpoint is described below.\n**SPECIALTIES IN CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL IMAGING:**\n●      Translation of novel CNS tracers\nThe Molecular Imaging and Research Clinic at KU Leuven (MIRaCLe) is well established in the validation and application of novel PET biomarkers to clinical populations for improved diagnosis and precision medicine for central nervous system (CNS) disease and especially neurodegeneration. The MIRaCLe platform focuses on translating novel PET candidates to first in human studies, including full quantitation and methodology development, as well as employing established markers for receptor occupancy studies in response to novel drugs in clinical populations, via interface with the UZL Clinical Trial unit.\n●      GMP production of nanobody theranostics\nThe *In vivo* Cellular and Molecular Imaging (ICMI) core facility at the VUB specialises in the development of new Nanobody-based (Nb) optical and nuclear diagnostic imaging probes and therapeutics for oncology and immuno-oncology in particular. Importantly, ICMI provides a GMP production platform for such Nb diagnostics & therapeutics, that includes selection of production vectors for (GMP-grade) Nanobody productions; Nanobody fermentation and purification protocols with qualification of in-process controls (IPCs) and analytical tests for follow-up and release; GLPgrade Nanobody batch production for *in vivo* PET imaging proof of concept studies and to support toxicity and stability studies and finally production of GMP-grade Nanobody batch that can be used for clinical translation.\n**SPECIALTIES IN PRECLINICAL IMAGING:**\n●      Multi-modality image-guided radiotherapy\nCORE ARTH (Animal facilities Radiological Techniques & Histology) Infinity at the University of Gent houses the SmART+ system for small animal irradiation, a unique system in Europe that combines multiple imaging modalities to allow the determination of biological target volumes (BTVs) for radiotherapy planning using non-uniform dose delivery protocols for automated nonhomogeneous doses.\nIn addition the facility has established pipelines for the integration of PET and MRI biomarkers to inform such higher dose delivery with the goal of targeting the more malignant or more radiation-resistant tumour areas. This comprehensive imaging biomarker platform also allows the monitoring of combination radio/chemotherapy responses and thus the validation of predictive imaging biomarkers.\n●      PET and High-field MRI characterisation of CNS disease models and therapy response\nThe *in vivo* small animal imaging facilities of the University of Antwerp consist of the Molecular Imaging Centre Antwerp and the Bio-Imaging Lab (MICA-BIL), and provides a battery of early biomarkers to evaluate neurodegenerative diseases, cancer as well as treatment response in a range of preclinical disease models. MICA-BIL makes use of PET biomarkers for the visualisation of proteinopathies, neuro-inflammation and presynaptic receptor density and combines functional connectivity and activity, structural integrity and connectivity from MRI. Fully optimised scan protocols and processing pipelines are available, including multi-modality integration to both increase predictive power and better discriminate underlying disease mechanisms and enable the early evaluation of potential treatments.\n**SPECIALTIES IN BIOLOGICAL IMAGING:**\no   Enteric Nervous System Imaging:\nThe Cell & Tissue Imaging Cluster (CIC) at KU Leuven integrates live fluorescence (single, two- and recently 3-photon), lattice light sheet and second and third harmonic imaging to provide multiplex real-time structural and physiological information on the enteric nervous system (ENS). The CIC is able to offer advanced (neuro)physiological imaging experimental setups involving (for example) the perfusion of drugs or electrical stimulation on widefield (incl. with high frame rate cameras), confocal, 2|3-photon, Abberior STED and Lattice Light sheet microscopes. Full protocols for physiological measurements in a range of sample types (including organs, tissue slices and organoids) on multiphoton/STED/LLS microscopes are available and extendable to allow pharmacological/electrical interventions at defined and accurate (ms) timepoints, with full analysis pipelines for the extraction and interpretation of valid physiological information from non-linear, superresolution and high-rate/noisy imaging data.\n* Correlative Light/Electron Microscopy:\nThe Biological Imaging Core (BIC) at the Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnology (VIB) houses a Zeiss Elyra 7-Structured Illumination Microscope (SIM)² equipped with the LSM980 two-photon module to enable accurate correlation of super-resolution light microscopy with EM data. This allows defined region study at resolutions ranging from 60nm (SIM²) to <20nm (PALM/d STORM) to nanometre ultrastructure via SEM, with Focused Ion Beam SEM (FIB-SEM) available to allow applications under cryo conditions. This dynamic 3D/4D super-resolution microscopy platform closes the resolution gap between LM and EM, expanding *in situ* structural analysis, and enables the correlation of protein clusters/complexes with morphological domains in organelles and tissues. Imaging neurodegenerative processes at the level of organelles and identifying the initial stages of protein/peptide aggregation, transmission and organellar involvement is a key focus, with the aim to better understand neurodegenerative mechanism(s) and identify novel targets for early diagnosis and therapy.\n* Pharmacokinetic Imaging:\nThe Gent Light Microscopy Core (GLiM; [www.ugent.be/glim](http://www.ugent.be/glim)) has expertise in pharmacokinetic imaging, i.e. the study of the physicochemical properties of single molecules and nanoparticles in biological systems. This technique makes use of advanced imaging (Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching, FRAP; Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy, FCS; Single Particle Tracking, SPT) with major applications in the study of drug delivery and nanoparticle therapy (nanomedicines) in a range of biological systems. GLiM also has unique and complementary expertise in the intracellular delivery of compounds, including labels for microscopy or preclinical imaging of cells, via ‘photoporation’ (valorized at GU via the formation of the spin-off Trince). A major focus is the development of techniques to elucidate nanoparticle transport mechanisms in spheroids and patient-derived tissue fragments with the goal of informing the development of a range of nanomedicines, with special focus on improved therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of cancer. Different pharmacological and biomechanical manipulations to enhance nanoparticle transport can also be studied and developed using these model systems and readouts.\n* Dynamic Optical Microscopy:\nThe Advanced Optical Microscopy Centre (AOMC) at the University of Hasselt has unique expertise in studying molecular dynamics via Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and image correlation spectroscopy (ICS), two powerful fluorescence methods especially suited to study the dynamics of live biological processes, enabling 'fluorescence-based dynamic structural biology’ investigations from the single-molecule scale via e.g. super-resolution, TIRF and confocal microscopes all the way to the organoid, organs and model organism length scale via state-of-the-art light-sheet microscopy. A particular focus is the application of FRET/ICS procedures to enable dynamic optical imaging in large multicellular assemblies and thus create a framework for super-resolved multidimensional correlation imaging (ICS) methods, furthermore to map viscosity/viscoelastic properties of/ diffusive heterogeneity within biomolecular assemblies below the 200-nm optical diffraction limit. Multiplex FRET combining space-and-time-resolved data recording is available to characterise heterogenous biological environments.\n* Systems microscopy:\nThe Antwerp Centre for Advanced Microscopy (ACAM;[www.acam-uantwerpen.be](http://www.acam-uantwerpen.be/)) develops data-driven microscopy approaches, based on a diversity of imaging technologies (incl. electron microscopy, high-throughput screening, live cell and light sheet microscopy) to gain insight in and expose novel therapeutic targets for human age-related diseases. ACAM has established end-to-end pipelines to query among others, oxidative stress and mitochondrial defects in human patient cells, synaptic connectivity in primary or iPSC-derived neurons, and DNA damage in cancer cells. High-end super-resolution and expansion microscopy in combination with cyclic staining is optimized for molecular-level investigations, while deep learning-enhanced image recognition enables cell type and state recognition in more complex, physiologically relevant biological specimens such as mixed cell cultures. A systematic workflow based on tissue clearing and light sheet microscopy allows cellular phenotyping of intact tissue mimics such as cerebral organoids and whole organs such as mouse brain. Thus, together our imaging expertise allows quantitative investigation of pathological defects across scales.\n### Additional services offered by the Node\n* Full project support, experimental design, user training\n* Wide range of disease models\n* Large animal scanning (mini-pigs)\n* BSL2 animal facility\n* SPF facility for high-field MRI imaging\n* Autoradiography of ex-vivo tissue with a wide range of isotopes\n* Laser microdissection and photoablation\n* Support for patient and subject recruitment for clinical studies\n* Support for obtaining preclinical and clinical ethical permission\n* Full clinical and preclinical quantitation for PET studies\n* Image processing and data analysis for all spearpoint technologies\n* Data storage and support for metadata definitions/implementation\n### Instrument Highlights\n**Clinical PET imaging:**\nTwo PET/CT scanners (GE Discovery MI, Siemens TruePoint), a simultaneous 3T PET/MRI (GE Healthcare Signa), four SPECT/CT scanners (Symbia Intevo Bold, GE Discovery NM530s CZT, GE Discovery MI, Siemens Symbia).

The integration of these three sites in one NL-HTM center creates a world leading expertise center in high-throughput microscopy for imaging based screening. Each center offers specific strength and expertise. Each of these sites has developed a high-end infrastructure covering a broad range of screening and imaging technologies. Leiden Cell Observatory is in particular experienced in high-throughput high-end microscopy using automated live cell time-lapse confocal microscopy in combination with focused RNAi and compound screening strategies. The CSC is specialized in automated high-throughput imaging based screens using low resolution high-throughput endpoint imaging. The NKI Screening Center is highly experienced and at the forefront in whole genome RNAi screening using genome-wide shRNA as well as siRNA libraries and the NKI Advanced Microscopy Center integrates high-end microscopy approaches into medium throughput automated microscopy settings.**\n### Specialties and expertise of the Node\nThe Dutch HTM flagship Node is specialized in the development and application of cell based screening assays in 2D and 3D with image-based assays and readouts. Screening platforms compromise small molecule collections, functional genomic screening collections including CRISPR, shRNA and siRNA. Special interest and expertise lies in the use of advanced fluorescence based reporter cell lines to monitor live signaling dynamics. For automated image analysis, screen analysis and data integration we have developed relevant image analysis and bioinformatics pipelines using different open sources software for image quantification. Another area of expertise is the use of quantitative data for computational modelling to obtain a mechanistic understanding of observed phenotypes. We also have extensive experience in combining HCS with functional imaging assays, employing e.g. FRET sensors for readout of second messenger cascades, receptor activation and receptor internalization. New fast FLIM approaches have been implemented on our automated microscopes as well.\n### Offered Technologies:\n*[ISIDORe](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/content/isidore) is a Horizon Europe funded project that brings together 154 partners from 32 countries around the world, and is designed to effectively support research on infectious diseases and increase preparedness for pandemic.*\n| Technologies | Euro-BioImaging | ISIDORe |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| High throughput microscopy/high content screening (HTM/HCS) | ✓ | ✓ |\n### Additional services offered by the Node\n* Instruments\n* Technical assistance to run instrument\n* Assistance with experimental design (e.g. experimental set up, choice of technique)\n* Training in infrastructure use\n* Probe preparation\n* Animal preparation\n* Wet lab space\n* Server Space\n* Data processing and analysis\n* Training workstations\n* Training seminar room\n* Biobanking, biological material storage and processing\n* Cell culture facilities - Safety level 1 and 2\n### Instrument highlights\nSpecial features of instruments at the NL-HTM node: 1) we have both high-end confocal microscopes all equipped for automated screening and low-end HTM imagers; 2) all microscopes set-ups are equipped for live cell imaging; 3) automated robotics dedicated to perform siRNA and compound screenings are associated with the HTM imagers.

      "documentation": "## ITALY\n## Phase Contrast Imaging Flagship Node Trieste\n---\n**The Italian Phase Contrast Imaging Flagship Node is based on the SYRMEP beamline of the Elettra Synchrotron light source (Trieste).\nThe main characteristics of Synchrotron Radiation, namely monochromaticity, high intensity and spatial coherence, allow the effective application of phase contrast techniques. Differently from conventional radiology, where the image formation relies on the absorption properties of the sample, these approaches are sensitive to the phase shifts produced by the sample on the incoming X-rays. Phase contrast is particularly effective for imaging of soft biological tissues, where the conventional technique has strong limitations due to the poor intrinsic X-ray absorption.\nThe beamline provides two stations working with monochromatic or white/pink X-ray beam for planar and Computed micro-Tomography (microCT) imaging.

As well as cutting-edge equipment, we bring together a broad spectrum of knowledge and expertise in extending the boundaries of biological imaging beyond the diffraction limit. Current technologies include dSTORM/PALM/DNA-PAINT on Nikon N-STORM and Olympus Cell Excellence systems, gSTED, Tau STED and FLIM-FRET on a Leica SP8 with FALCON FLIM, Structured Illumination Microscopy on a Nikon N-SIM /SoRa hybrid system, and SRRF on an Andor Dragonfly spinning disk. Our equipment enables us to image objects in 3D at super-resolution in up to 4 colours, with resolutions ranging from 120nm down to 10nm.\n**[Francis Crick Institute:](https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/platforms-and-facilities/light-microscopy)** Lightsheet microscopy (from live organoids and embryos to\nfixed whole mouse organs), High Resolution                                                     Episcopic\nMicroscopy (HREM), Optical Projection Tomography (OPT)\nWe offer two methods for imaging thick samples, Lightsheet microscopy and High Resolution Episcopic Microscopy (HREM), with support for the entire experimental workflow, including sample prep, clearing, image analysis, and data management.\nOur Lightsheet systems cover two distinct application spaces: Larger fixed samples (10 - 20 mm) can be imaged with the LaVision Ultramicroscope whereas smaller living or fixed samples (50 - 500 µm) can be imaged with either the Luxendo MuVi or Viventis LS1. The Ultramicroscope can be used in combination with antibody labelling and tissue clearing to image many sample types, including whole mouse organs, later-stage embryos, tumors, and tissue sections. In contrast the MuVi and LS1 are suitable for live imaging of small samples such as spheroids, organoids, and early-stage embryos. The LS1 offers higher throughput whereas the MuVi can image thicker samples, and has been adapted with a pulsed IR laser for photo-stimulation.\nHREM is a simple block-face approach for imaging tissue and organ morphology that does not require endogenous tissue fluorescence or any form of antibody labelling. It was originally developed to characterise embryonic lethal mouse mutations and has been used to study cardiovascular, skeletal, and neurological defects in a wide variety of mouse models (eg: Vanyai et al, Development 2020.)\n[*King’s College London:*](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/facilities/euro-bioimaging-uk-node) STORM ,SIM, Lightsheet, FLIM, CLEM,Volume EM,\nLA-ICP-MS, Raman\nAt the atomic and nano scales, we support volume EM and CLEM workflows, cryo SEM and cryo TEM and are experts in freeze fracture. We provide cryo-focused ion beam SEM and are developing a complete pipeline from live cell to cryo ET leading to sub-tomographic averaging of proteins in situ.\nMoving down the resolution scale, we provide access and support in, super-resolution and low-toxicity live cell imaging (N-STORM 5.0 and SoRa, plus single and multi-photon lightsheet capability), as well as high-content and throughput spinning disc (Opera Phenix).\nExtending beyond optical imaging, we deliver analytical multi-modal imaging in the form of 2D or 3D spatial quantitative elemental and molecular imaging of both endogenous elements and metal tagged antibodies in cells and tissues using a multiplexing methodology whilst identifying associated lipids and biomolecules in a label free approach. Routine LA-ICP-MS (Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) has been integrated with DESI (Desorption electrospray ionisation)-MS and Raman Spectroscopy as a single unique correlative workflow. Together with integration of IR, this workflow will enable high resolution spatial mapping of lipid, nucleic acids and protein phosphorylation.\n[*Liverpool:*](https://cci.liv.ac.uk/index.html) Automated Live Cell Imaging, STORM, PALM, Bio AFM-TIRF, SIM2, Lightsheet, Cytometry, volume EM, TEM, MicroCT,                                Photoacoustic\nWe provide an integrated ensemble of imaging modalities in one place for imaging across scales from single molecule to cells and model organisms. Example projects include cell biology, surface science, biochemistry, and microbiology. Of particular note is our unique Bio AFM-TIRF imaging system for atomic force microscopy combined with dual fluorescence total internal reflection. We support the entire experimental workflow for each technique with dedicated staff, and we use an OMERO server for data management.\n[*Octopus:*](https://www.clf.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/Octopus-new.aspx) MINFLUX, CLEM with superresolution and cryoFIB-SEM,\nSIM, STORM/PALM, STED, Lightsheet, Multiphoton,\nFIB-SEM,                             FLIM/PLIM, Optical Trapping, TIRF, Raman, Single\nMolecule Tracking\nWe offer multiple microscopy techniques on a suite of commercial and custom-built systems, including MINFLUX, light sheet, single molecule localisation microscopy (PALM/STORM, including cryo-STORM), STED, single molecule methods including tracking and Fluorophore Localisation Imaging with Photobleaching (5 nm precision), confocal (including two photon and FRET/FLIM), optical trapping, and cryo focused ion beam SEM.\nThe microscopes are co-located with extensive preparation facilities including laboratories for biochemistry, cell biology, and chemistry. Facility users have access to a dedicated support team including microscopists, cell and molecular biologists, chemists, and data analysis experts. Users are provided with assistance at all stages of the experiment, including sample preparation and labelling, collection of data, and data analysis and interpretation. Custom data analysis packages are available and can be tailored to the requirements of a particular experiment. Accommodation and catering facilities are available on campus.\n[Oxford Brookes:](https://www.brookes.ac.uk/research/units/hls/centres/centre-for-bioimaging) SBF-SEM, SEM (tomography), CLEM, Cellular Electron\nTomography, High Pressure Freezing\nWe focus on providing volumeEM and CLEM workflows, including dual axis serial section cellular electron tomography and serial block face-scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM). We can work with fixed or high pressure frozen samples and have extensive expertise in eukaryotic parasite work and insect vectors. The centre is equipped with CATII culturing facilities within the Centre, as well as a SAPO licence to support these projects.\n[*York:*](https://www.york.ac.uk/biology/technology-facility/imaging-cytometry/) SIM, Multiphoton, Spatial Transcriptomics (GeoMX), Phase\nImaging /Holography, Confocal, Slide Scanner, cryoTEM,\ncryoSEM\nCurrent technologies include PALM/STORM/SIM2 via the Zeiss ELYRA 7, Spatial-omics via Nanostring GeoMX-DSP and 10X Visium, Label-free imaging via PhaseFocus LiveCyte and Tomocube and multiphoton imaging via Zeiss LSM980 AiryScan2 along with the more routine confocal, slide scanning and scanning and electron microscopy. The team have a wide breadth of biological expertise spanning plant sciences through to biomedicine, and are familiar with most sample types and sample preparation methods.\n### Additional services offered by the Node\n* Project planning and management\n* Wet lab\n* Cell culture facilities\n* Methodological setup\n* Facility induction\n* Technical assistance to prepare experiments and run instruments\n* Workstations\n* Data storage\n* Image acquisition\n* Image processing and analysis\n**Probes**\nAll sites within the EuBI UK Node operate within leading edge academic institutions and as such, many different types of probes, including plasmids, antibodies and chemical reagents are available within individual researcher labs. Additionally, a number of facilities maintain their own in-house reagents, including pre-labelled antibodies for super-resolution (STORM) and spatial transcriptomics.\n**Other model organisms**\nAll sites within the EuBI UK Node operate within leading edge academic institutions that host labs working with a broad range of different model organisms, including zebrafish, Drosophila and c.elegans. Facilities to support users working with such organisms would therefore be possible, subject to discussions and agreements with the appropriate academics.\n**High biological safety level**\nBSL2 facilities are available within a number of the laboratories at the host institutions for the EuBI UK Node facilities and can be made available to users following consultation with the site leads. Of note, Oxford Brookes holds a SAPO license for culturing Trypanosoma brucei within the imaging facility itself.\n### Instrument Highlights\n[***ESRIC:***](https://www.esric.org/)dSTORM/PALM/DNA-PAINT on Nikon N-STORM and Olympus Cell Excellence systems, gSTED, Tau STED and FLIM-FRET on a Leica SP8 with FALCON FLIM, SIM on a Nikon N-SIM /SoRa hybrid system, and SRRF on an Andor Dragonfly spinning disk.

It aims to provide an outstanding international forum in the area of Europe and neighbouring regions for the face to face exchange of knowledge and ideas across the molecular life sciences. The core scientific programme comprises inspiring plenary lectures from distinguished researchers working in areas of high topical interest, and a range of themed symposia providing focused updates from leading experts in each field. The contribution of participants towards the scientific discussion at the event is encouraged by the opportunity to present work through extensive poster sessions, and submitted abstracts may also be considered for oral presentations. The broad subject coverage of the Congress and its size provide an excellent setting for participants to gain valuable insight into progress in research areas beyond their own. Furthermore, additional activities or special sessions aim to engage participants on wider issues, such as teaching in the molecular life sciences. A commercial exhibition provides additional interest. The FEBS Congress has a strong emphasis on support, education and inspiration for the next generation of scientists, with a bursary scheme for early-career researchers, a satellite Young Scientists’ Forum, and activities to encourage interaction with peers and experts. Altogether FEBS Congresses aim to be an exemplary cross-discipline gathering in the molecular life sciences for research presentation, discussion, learning, inspiration and encouragement, with participants leaving with new research knowledge and ideas, and perhaps the beginnings of international collaborations and friendships. Generally, Euro-BioImaging Hub team members attend this event with research infrastructure partners. More information",

      "documentation": "Mentoring We are delighted to introduce a new training pillar within the framework of EVOLVE , our Mentoring Program! Euro-BioImaging’s Mentoring Program will strengthen our Node Community by forging relationships with members from other Nodes, with the Global BioImaging network and industry. These mentoring relationships aim to benefit both mentors and mentees and support skill building, career development and daily operations. Apply Why join Euro-BioImaging's Mentoring Program? Staff in imaging facilities usually work closely in small teams and sometimes even by themselves, which means they might miss out on different viewpoints, expertise in different areas, and career perspectives. While having a direct supervisor is important, sometimes you need advice from outside your usual crew – maybe someone with different skills or a fresh outlook. By fostering peer-to-peer support , Euro-BioImaging’s Mentoring Program aims to fill this gap. How does it work? Mentoring pairs are carefully matched based on their skills and experience , rather than merely seniority level. The specific areas of professional development that mentees have highlighted as important are central for the selection of the mentor. Pairs are encouraged to meet at least once a month for a six-month period, during which they establish concrete goals to strive towards. These relationships can be short-term, focused on achieving specific objectives, or they can pave the way to longer-term collaborations, including the participation in our Job Shadowing Program . Who can be your mentor? Members at the: Euro-BioImaging Nodes Global Imaging Network Euro-BioImaging Industry Board and Industry partners Potential Areas of Mentoring Career Development User service support Data Management Soft Skill Development (leadership, negotiation, conflict resolution, team building) Business Strategy and Planning Technical advice Guidance on Green Sustainable Practices and more… Who can apply? All imaging core facility staff from Euro-BioImaging and the Global BioImaging network are welcome to apply. How to apply? First track Both mentors and mentees are encouraged to fill out the application form linked below. Our training team will go through the applications and reach out with your proposed match. Euro-BioImaging’s training team will support pairs for a set duration. Second track Dual program targeted to participants of the Euro-BioImaging Job Shadowing Program.

      "documentation": "EU Project CANDLE starts building National Cancer Data Nodes Published June 24, 2025 Category Funded Projects The EU-funded project CANDLE – National CAncer data Node DeveLopErs – officially kicked off on 1st of June 2025, launching its three-year mission to build a robust cancer research infrastructure across EU Member States. This project is coordinated by Health-RI and with a consortium of 40 partners from 20 European countries. CANDLE will support Member States in setting up National Cancer Data Nodes which will be able to manage and share cancer data nationally and across borders, connecting different national actors. Euro-BioImaging ERIC will assist in the design of national nodes, support their user communities, develop a network resource kit, and provide guidance on best practices for data use. We will work closely with the Euro-BioImaging Radiology and Medical Imaging Valencia Node in Valencia , the European Research Infrastructure Consortiums (ERICs) in Life Sciences and the Finnish National Cancer Center (FICAN) to support the development  of National Cancer Data nodes in Europe. CANDLE is a continuation of our commitment to support the EU Mission on Cancer as we started through over  key initiatives like canSERV, EOSC4Cancer and EUCAIM which complement our mission in enabling cutting-edge research, open access to advanced imaging technologies, data services, and collaborative research infrastructure, and fosters the development of AI tools for improved diagnosis and treatment. The National Cancer Data Nodes implemented in CANDLE will closely link to other European cancer data projects as recommended in the UNCAN blueprint: 1) the UNCAN.eu platform, UNCAN-CONNECT, a federated cancer data infrastructure being developed under the upcoming EU project , and 2) the European Cancer Patient Digital Centre (ECPDC). Driving Integration Across Europe CANDLE will strategically support the European Health Data Space (EHDS) by creating a federated network of national cancer data nodes, acting as disease-specific EHDS demonstrators. This initiative also implements the EU Mission on Cancer and Europe's Beating Cancer Plan nationally. The CANDLE Consortium, including Euro-BioImaging, will ensure the adoption of best practices in data sharing, enhance data access maturity, and foster cross-domain collaboration, directly contributing to EHDS goals.

      "documentation": "Strategic Goals With its Strategic Plan for 2024-2028, Euro-BioImaging enters a new phase of its development, aiming to significantly influence the future of imaging and facilitate access to imaging technology, data and expertise. Over the past four years, Euro-BioImaging has made significant progress towards building an internationally recognised, pre-eminent, open-access imaging research infrastructure. This 2024–2028 strategic plan outlines the vision for the continued contributions of Euro-BioImaging to the life sciences through six strategic goals and their planned implementation. This page provides an overview of Euro-BioImaging's six strategic goals for 2024-2028. The entire Strategic Plan can be downloaded here , and the summary can be downloaded here . Below, you can access the embedded version of the entire Strategic Plan. Euro-BioImaging Strategic Plan Strategic goal 1: Provide cutting-edge imaging services, contribute to scientific excellence and promote Open Science > Our aim To be increasingly attractive to users, Euro-BioImaging aims to ensure the competitiveness of its imaging technology portfolio and will continue to adapt its services regularly to evaluate and adapt its services regularly based on user feedback, research into advanced imaging technologies, and data processing and analysis. The approach to meeting this first strategic goal is divided into three essential tasks: Advancing the services at Euro-BioImaging by continually including innovative imaging technologies Providing FAIR image data services Offering a broad training portfolio for users and staff > How do we plan to achieve it? Euro-BioImaging's readiness relies on its capacity to adapt and update its portfolio of services and technologies to upcoming scientific needs. We plan to continuously assess upcoming innovations, technologies, and methods that fit the needs of our Nodes and user communities. The feedback loops we have built during the last three years will be determinant in adopting innovations and quickly filtering out non-anymore-relevant technologies or methods. On the data front, we will reinforce and scale up Euro-BioImaging capabilities to meet the upcoming growth in image data generation and storage and support our stakeholder's needs. We will maintain the high-quality service we have been providing since the creation of the infrastructure while establishing new guidelines, knowledge transfer, stewardship and processes to support FAIRness, enhance FAIRification of our data, and increase expertise among our staff, our Nodes and the imaging community. We will continue developing our efforts towards cloud-compatible and machine-ready data formats to match ever-growing imaging data needs. Our position as a European Landmark research infrastructure gives us the unique capacity to connect and interact with various stakeholders. Our Nodes and existing communities are fundamental to us: we aim to strengthen our relations with these two critical groups through dedicated events, projects and initiatives and reinforce bidirectional collaboration. We will also increase contact points with our Nodes to enhance dialogue, feedback, and interaction by implementing new expert groups to increase user access. We want these efforts to generate benefits and increase funding opportunities for the Nodes and Euro-BioImaging. Relying on our central position as an imaging research infrastructure, we also aim to widen our community of users by offering remote access tailored to cover the unmatched needs of the European Research Area. We plan to boost our staff skills and knowledge to support our Nodes and users better. Through managerial and technical support training, we aim to continually update our knowledge on crucial issues related to topics as diverse as governance or AI. We strive to launch and coordinate a modular system of advanced, feedback-based training and a coordinated career path to ensure that core facility staff can advance their knowledge and careers. In addition, we will establish a job-shadowing programme across Nodes in Europe and beyond to increase capacity in facility management and operations. Strategic goal 2: Engage with national and international stakeholder networks and increase synergy with other research infrastructures > Our aim Maintaining, strengthening, and enlarging our stakeholder network is fundamental to Euro-BioImaging's success. As a pan-European research infrastructure, international collaboration and partnerships to advance the field of biological and biomedical imaging are paramount. > How we plan to achieve it Euro-BioImaging will continue to build solid and sustainable partnerships with existing member states and funding agencies and engage with key stakeholders to secure the infrastructure's long-term development and growth. We are in dialogue with potential new members, especially countries in the European widening area. Through dedicated outreach channels, we aim to better engage with th",

      "description": "FAIR data training, resources, 1-on-1 guidance, contact fairdata@eurobioimaging.eu.",
      "documentation": "FAIR image data As a result of the digital revolution, scientific data must be created with longevity in mind more than ever before. FAIR data increase the value of scientific data by enabling it to be more easily incorporated into a variety of different research projects. The FAIR principles thus facilitate and accelerate knowledge generation and scientific progress, improve research transparency, and foster collaboration within the scientific community. FAIR principles Q&A What does FAIR actually stand for? According to the FAIR principles (1), scientific data is of the highest value if it is: Findable : Data and associated Metadata should be easy to find and discover for both humans and computers by a standard identification mechanism Accessible : (Meta)data are available and obtainable by their identifier using a standardized communication protocol; even if the data itself is restricted, the metadata is visible Interoperable : Data needs to be integratable with other data and into applications or workflows for analysis, processing and storage by the use of shared and broadly applicable language Reusable : To optimize the data for reuse, the data and metadata should be richly described by accurate and relevant attributes. What are the challenges for BioImage data? Biological imaging methods present special challenges in regards to FAIR, as they likely generate large volumes (up to several TB) of often complex and multidimensional data in various (proprietary) file formats that must be properly handled, processed and stored. Supporting FAIR image data The FAIRification process often begins by recognizing the value of FAIR data and subsequently making adjustments in data acquisition, processing and management where appropriate. Euro-BioImaging promotes and facilitates the adoption of FAIR practices relevant to image data which get implemented at our Nodes and the Hub. To this end, we offer resources, training and 1-on-1 guidance to FAIRify your data in all stages of the data lifecycle – from project planning to data deposition and reuse. We also work closely with dedicated image data repositories making important connections between the resources and the users. Contact: fairdata@eurobioimaging.eu FAIR training We have launched the ' Euro-BioImaging's Guide to FAIR BioImage Data ' series of events, which aims to introduce the FAIR principles in the context of bioimaging and provide you with simple yet effective steps for a smooth start to your FAIR journey. View all events The \"Webinar on Data Management of Preclinical Image Datasets\" showcases the tools developed to improve the discoverability, access, interoperability, and reusability of preclinical image datasets, consequently providing a solid step towards the adoption of the FAIR principles of our imaging community. Learn more FAIR resources Data deposition recipe in FAIRcookbook One of the critical aspects of data sharing is data deposition, which is often not as straightforward as it needs to be for rapid data exchange. We have therefore created a step-by-step process for depositing bioimage data in the BioImage Archive.

      "documentation": "New technologies Innovation in imaging technologies in life sciences is continuous, fast and exciting. To remain at the technological forefront, Euro-BioImaging has established a workflow to ensure that new technologies are continuously integrated into our portfolio. The expert imaging facility staff at the Euro-BioImaging Nodes are developing many new imaging methods and are making the latest developments available in open access. On the right, Nicolas D'Ascenzo of our NEUROMED DIMP Node, proudly shows off the portable PET machine he is developing to study plant growth in the field. Suggest a new imaging technology Whether you are a technology developer, provider, or Euro-BioImaging user, use this simple form to inform us of a new imaging technology. The technology may be either completely new, or new to Euro-BioImaging. After you have made a suggestion for a new technology, the workflow for its inclusion into the Euro-BioImaging portfolio is: The technology is Showcased by a person or group to demonstrate the user need, its relevance to the scientific community and user access feasibility. (Not all suggestions lead to Showcasing.) After successful showcasing, a Proof-of-Concept study is arranged to confirm that the new technology can be offered as an open access service via Euro-BioImaging. After a successful Proof-of-Concept, the technology is accepted into the Euro-BioImaging portfolio and becomes available to everyone. To Euro-BioImaging Nodes: If you wish to add more technologies from the Euro-BioImaging portfolio to your Node, use this simple form . See below for more information and current technologies in Showcasing and Proof-of-Concept studies. Showcasing new imaging technologies Any technology developer/provider/imaging facility at a public research institution/university which is offering a new technology to external users can perform a Showcasing - it is not limited to Euro-BioImaging Nodes. In fact, Showcasing can also be a stepping-stone for becoming a Euro-BioImaging Node. Euro-BioImaging does not coordinate Showcasing, but facilities are invited to inform us of ongoing Showcasing. Afterwards, a simple report needs to be sent to us, if the new technology is to proceed towards becoming a Euro-BioImaging technology. If you are about to start Showcasing, please tell us about it , so we can advertise your Showcasing. If you are a user and interested in a technology being Showcased, tell us about it . This will help us in making it a Euro-BioImaging technology. If you have completed Showcasing, please send us a simple report . Currently ongoing/completed Showcases Soft X-ray Tomography (showcasing successfully concluded March 2023) EPR imaging Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (Please see below for a list of technologies that have already moved from Showcasing to Proof-of-Concept studies.) Proof-of-Concept studies A new technology with user need and a functional access model demonstrated by the Showcasing process is included in the next available round of Proof-of-Concept studies (PCS). At this point, access to the technology is possible via Technologies on our Web Portal, just like for any other technology. Technologies undergoing Proof-of-Concept studies are marked with a star (*) in the technology listing and the Proof-of-Concept study has a defined time frame, after which the user demand and user and provider experience is reviewed by our Scientific Advisory Board to evaluate the Proof-of-Concept study. If the Proof-of-Concept studies are successful, the technology is then included into the Euro-BioImaging portfolio permanently. Visit our Proof-of-Concept page to learn more about the new technologies Euro-BioImaging offers. If you are a Node wishing to offer a technology for a proof-of-concept study, please let us know by sending an email to info@eurobioimaging.eu .
