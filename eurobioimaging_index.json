Images are acquired by raster scanning a nanometric tip in gentle contact or intermittent contact with the sample. The tip is positioned at the end of a micrometric force transducer, the AFM cantilever: it records the variation of sample topography due to changes of tip-sample interaction during scanning operation. In addition, by measuring the tip-sample interaction force as a function of the tip-sample distance, AFMs can evaluate sample elastic and viscous properties.**\nAFM is nowadays recognized as an outstanding technique in the membrane field. Vertical and lateral resolution in the nanometer range can be achieved in buffer, a great advantage as compared to other structural biology techniques. In addition, due to a high signal to noise ratio, AFM often does not require image averaging, limiting the number of acquisitions. AFM has been widely used to probe at the nanoscale both topography and physical properties of biological membranes, purified or in intact cells. Besides this application, it is an instrument suitable to get high resolution pictures of filamentous structures (amyloid fibres, DNA, intrinsically disordered proteins…) as well as viral particles or bacteria.\nInitially limited by the time to acquire an image, tremendous progress in AFM during the last 10 years laid on the development of high-speed (HS)-AFM that enables dynamic imaging of biological samples.\nIn addition, AFM topography can also be combined with fluorescence microscopy (conventional and super resolution microscopy as well as spectroscopy) to correlate topography and mapping of a component of interest.\n![](upload/AFM.jpg)\nTopography of a supported lipid bilayer after direct incorporation of photosynthetic complexes imaged by atomic force microscopy” from Berquand et al, 2007, Ultramicroscopy 107, 928-933",

It allows for chemically specific imaging of biological materials without use of fluorescent labels. CARS is a three-photon nonlinear optical process where two synchronous and spatially overlapped optical beams are used to probe molecular vibrations in the sample material. The method is based on stimulated Raman scattering which makes CARS imaging much faster than confocal Raman mapping based on spontaneous Raman scattering (at least 100 times faster). Different experimental realizations of CARS microscopy exist. Typical is the visualization of a selected single vibrational frequency, for example the CH2 symmetric stretching mode around 2800 cm-1. Spectral scanning is realized by tuning the excitation wavelength step-by-step. The alternative approach is hyperspectral CARS which is based on broadband excitation and detection of vibrational frequencies in a wider spectral range simultaneously.**\nModalities offered within Euro-BioImaging include single-frequency CARS imaging, combined into multi-mode simultaneous imaging of CARS, SHG and 2P-fluorescence signals.\nCARS has been proven useful in some very specific application fields. The CARS technique is particularly well suited for high-resolution label-free imaging of lipids due to the high concentration of carbon-hydrogen bonds in the lipid material. Lipid imaging has been applied to a great variety of samples including lipid droplets in fixed and live cell cultures, various tissue sections, and even small animals in vivo (e.g. zebrafish). In pharmaceutical applications, CARS microscopy is gaining more and more interest. Applications include visualization of chemical component distribution in dosage forms and drug carriers, dissolution and release, solid-state transformations during dissolution, and drug delivery into cells and tissues.\n![](upload/CARS.PNG)\nSimultaneous imaging of GFP-labelled protein ATGL-1, taking part in lipid metabolism of C.elegans, and unstained lipid droplets by CARS in a living embryo of C. elegans.

It can resolve the absorbers located in turbid media. Since the contrast is purely based on optical absorption, the imaging depth of PAI goes beyond the optical mean free path. Depending on specific configurations, PAI can be divided into photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) and photoacoustic tomography (PAT).**\n**Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), on the other hand, uses scattering contrast. When light impinges upon layered structures, backscattered light from interfaces in the sample interferes with a reference light beam, forming modulated interferogram, which can in turn lead to the reconstruction of inner structures of biological samples in vivo. By using wideband low coherence light sources, OCT can achieve subcellular spatial resolution as well as high temporal resolution. In addition to structural imaging, an extension of OCT, namely OCT angiography (OCTA), can produce contrast based on speckle or phase variance, which has seen increasing applications in ophthalmology and dermatology.**\n**OCT can be combined with PAM to form the so-called optical coherence photoacoustic microscopy (OC-PAM) system whereas when PAT is combined with OCT, the system is named optical coherence photoacoustic tomography (OC-PAT).**\nOC-PAT is normally used for large field of view imaging. The lateral imaging range can reach up to 15 mm × 15 mm and the imaging depth can reach 5 mm and deeper in soft tissue. One unique application for such a system is in dermatology as demonstrated below.\n![](upload/Pictureoctpat.png)\n*(a) OCT B-scan of skin over the dashed line in (b). (b) Photo of a surgical scar.

Array tomography (AT) encompasses light and electron microscopy modalities that offer unparalleled opportunities to explore 3D cellular architectures of large samples in extremely fine tructural and molecular detail. Fluorescence-AT achieves much higher resolution and molecular multiplexing than most other fluorescence microscopy methods, while electron-AT can capture 3D ultrastructure easily and rapidly compared to traditional serial-section electron microscopy methods. The Correlative mode of Array Tomography (CAT) furthermore offers the unique capacity of merging the molecular discrimination strengths of multichannel fluorescence microscopy with the ultrastructural imaging strengths of electron microscopy and validating single-modality conclusions since each technique provides unique information based on fundamentally different contrast methods. This new technology covers the current state-of-the-art in volume electron microscopy imaging applied to very large and complex biological samples, including neural circuits, organs (e.g., pancreas, kidney, heart), small model organisms and subcellular organelle networks.",

DWM typically causes less photoxicicity on the samples, so it is well suited for observation of cells in culture for long periods, and it easily allows the observation of unstained live-cells using DIC/Nomarski or Phase-contrast.\n## DECONVOLUTION WIDEFIELD MICROSCOPY\n---\n**Deconvolution is a computational technique for improving the contrast and resolution of digital images. It includes a suite of methods that seek to remove or reverse the blurring present in microscopes images caused by the limited aperture of the microscope objective lens. Nearly any image acquired on a digital fluorescence microscope can be deconvolved. In addition, new applications to transmitted light images are now available. Three-dimensional images made up of a series of optical sections are particularly well suited for improvement by deconvolution.**",

      "documentation": "## Image Scanning Microscopy (ISM)\n---\n**Image Scanning microscopy is a method for increasing resolution of a confocal microscope. This is achieved by replacing the point detector of a classical confocal with an array detector. Each pixel of the array detector records its own scan image when the sample is scanned with the laser spot and the individual images are then combined into a single image. The final ISM image corresponds theoretically to an image with a confocal taken with an entirely closed pinhole, which results in the increased resolution observed. ISM has the potential to nearly double the resolution of a confocal imaging system. Multiple commercial implementations of Image Scanning Microscopy exist both on laser scanning confocals as well as spinning disk systems, such as AiryScan, rescan confocal microscope and SoRa. Non-commercial ISM solutions are also available and in general ISM can be applied to 2-photon imaging and many other light microscopy modalities. Please contact the Node offering the technology to find out more about the specific implementation offered.**",

These include various analyses of vascular function, following the migration and cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions of e.g. immune cells or invasive/metastatic tumor cells in different tissues, and changes in e.g. neuronal or astrocyte morphology in response to stimulus or injury. Intravital brain imaging is increasingly done in awake rodents, which allows the integration of e.g. sensory cues for analysis of behavioral responses.

These techniques can be combined with optical manipulation systems, such as laser ablation or optogenetic manipulation systems, and also with a range of e.g. neurological or behavioral stimuli especially when awake, immobilized animals are imaged.\nIntravital imaging allows the real-time visualization of cellular processes in their native environment in the living organism. It can be performed as repetitive imaging on the same animal, allowing biological processes to be tracked over long periods of time, or as acute experiments.**\nSome Euro-BioImaging Nodes offer Intravital Imaging in direct association with animal houses, which is required especially for chronic or repeated imaging.\nIntravital microscopy is used for a wide variety of applications where dynamic processes in intact tissue environments need to be understood (see the review articles below for a range of examples). These include various analyses of vascular function, following the migration and cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions of e.g. immune cells or invasive/metastatic tumor cells in different tissues, and changes in e.g. neuronal or astrocyte morphology in response to stimulus or injury. Intravital brain imaging is increasingly done in awake rodents, which allows the integration of e.g. sensory cues for analysis of behavioral responses. A constantly increasing variety of functional probes can also be used for intravital microscopy, including calcium indicators, environmental sensors, FRET probes and enzyme-activated probes.\n* Pittet MJ, Weissleder R.

The key feature of confocal microscopy is its ability to acquire in-focus images from selected depths, a process known as optical sectioning. Images are acquired point-by-point and reconstructed with a computer. This allows three-dimensional reconstructions of topologically complex objects. However, CLSM is significantly slower than widefield or spinning-disk confocal microscopy, because images are acquired pixel-by-pixel and the laser power is concentrated on small diffraction limited spots which increases the phototoxicity load on the samples. CLSM typically requires high-laser power excitation, which can lead to phototoxicity and limited observation of live cells. This technology can be improved with image scanning mic/pixel reassignment to allow non-diffraction limited images which provide resolutions 100-200nm (check with the lab where these improvements are available).**",

MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields, radiofrequency pulses, and field gradients to generate images of soft tissues throughout the body.**\nContrast agents based on paramagnetic compounds are commonly used to enhance the signal/noise ratio and assess vascularization or tissue permeability. More recently,  novel classes of contrast agents have been developed, such as hyperpolarized molecules for high sensitivity metabolic studies, or CEST agents for accurate pH parametric imaging.\nMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) can be used to complement MRI in the characterization of tissues. While MRI makes use of water proton signals to create images, MRS uses either proton or heteronuclei signals to determine the relative concentrations of metabolites within a specific organ/tissue.\nMRI scanners at high magnetic fields have the advantage to significantly increase the sensitivity and thus improve the image resolution and scan duration. MRS also benefits from high magnetic fields with an increased spectral resolution, which improves the separation between different chemical components. Nowadays, scanners at 3-7 Tesla are commonly used for both humans and animals, but for small-medium animal studies high field scanners operating at 7-9.4T are also quite common. Ultra-high field MR systems with fields of up to 17 T are also available mainly for preclinical studies.\nIn microMRI/MRS, the instruments are technically optimized for small animal studies, providing resolution in the mm to µm range.\nMRI, either as a single modality or paired to other imaging modalities, is largely used for *in vivo* (humans and animals) studies and also for ex-vivo analysis of specimens (organs or tissue samples).\nIn preclinical imaging, animal models of various pathologies, from tumors to cardiovascular, neurological or metabolic disorders, are commonly used to monitor disease development and to test the efficacy of therapeutic treatments, to develop novel diagnostic tools etc. Several quantitative imaging biomarkers can be used to monitor disease progression over time.\nAnimal imaging can also be used for veterinary studies.\nAt clinical level, MRI is generally a key tool for the diagnosis of various pathologies and for monitoring the efficacy of new therapies. It is also commonly used in studies involving healthy volunteers to evaluate metabolism or functions.\nMRI comprises a large number of techniques for various applications ranging from simple morphological measurements throughout all organs to the evaluation of complex systems, functions, and processes in living organisms.\n**Preclinical and ex-vivo MRI**is provided by the following Nodes:\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed - DIMP NEUROMED](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Facility of Multimodal Imaging - AMMI Maastricht (NL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/facility-of-excellence-in-imaging---alm-and-molecular-imaging-node-maastricht)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Medical and Preclinical Imaging Hungary (HU)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Population Imaging Node Valencia (ES)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/population-imaging-valencia)\n* [Preclinical Imaging Centre (PRIME) - Molecular Imaging Dutch Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node)\n* [NORMOLIM, Norwegian Molecular Imaging Infrastructure](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)\n**Human MRI** is provided by the following Nodes:\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Population Imaging Node Valencia (ES)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/population-imaging-valencia)\n### Use cases\nClick here for\n[Use Cases](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/preclinical-and-medical-imaging-technologies-use-cases-from-our-nodes/) from our Nodes.\n## Anatomical, volumetric, morphometric MRI\nContrast in MRI images is generated by the differences in the nuclear relaxation times of water protons (T1 and T2) across tissues. The image contrast can be controlled by changing the values of specific acquisition parameters, generally the echo time (TE) and the repetition time (TR). Depending on their values, it is possible to obtain images where the contrast and brightness are predominantly determined by the T1 or T2 properties of water in tissues (T1-weighted and T2-weighted images respectively).\nContrast agents are frequently administered to enhance the contrast for assessment of organ functions (perfusion, vascularity, permeability) or better delineation of specific lesions or tissues. Mainly Gd based molecules are used with the acquisition of T1-weighted images and for specific cases iron Oxides could be used with T2-weighted images.\nThe acquisition of anatomical MR images is done with the scope of obtaining detailed morphological information ( shape, size, volume, texture…) of various body regions or lesions (e.g. tumors, ischemia, cysts etc) and to monitor disease progression or regression.\n* Kinnunen K. M., et al. \"Volumetric MRI-Based Biomarkers in Huntington's Disease: An Evidentiary Review\", <https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.712555>\n* McCarthy J., et al. \"Morphometric MRI as a diagnostic biomarker of frontotemporal dementia: A systematic review to determine clinical applicability\", <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2018.08.028>\nWhile MR images are typically assessed in a qualitative way, MRI can collect quantitative information about tissue properties. The range of properties includes the magnetic resonance (MR) relaxation times T1 and T2, T2\\*, diffusion, perfusion, fat and water fractions, iron fraction, elastic properties of tissue, temperature, chemical composition, and chemical exchange, just to mention some. Of note, new MRI methods are constantly being developed. By using the sensitivity of MRI to these tissue properties, it is possible to generate quantitative maps instead of qualitative anatomical images, where the intensity of each pixel corresponds to a measurement of one specific physical or physiological property. Quantitative measurements could help not only for identifying anatomical abnormalities but also for detecting initial loss of function or tissue alteration.\n[Use cases](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/content/use-cases/#volumetric)\n**Available at:**\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed - DIMP NEUROMED](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Facility of Multimodal Imaging - AMMI Maastricht (NL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/facility-of-excellence-in-imaging---alm-and-molecular-imaging-node-maastricht)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Medical and Preclinical Imaging Hungary (HU)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Preclinical Imaging Centre (PRIME) - Molecular Imaging Dutch Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node)\n* [NORMOLIM, Norwegian Molecular Imaging Infrastructure](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Medical and Preclinicial Imaging Hungary](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n## Relaxation mapping - T1, T2, T2\\*, spin-lock MR techniques\nThe signal intensity in  MR images is  a function of water content, tissue properties and of MRI acquisition parameters.\nFor quantitative MR imaging, tissue relaxation times are measured by extracting the signal exponential decay (T2 or T2\\*) or recovery (T1) from multiple measurements.  T1, T2 and/or T1rho parametric images can be acquired.\nThe quantification of relaxation times provides more detailed information on the tissue characteristics (tumor cells invasion, ischemic lesions, vascular leakage, iron deposition, inflammation etc), thus supporting the clinicians in the diagnostic process.

Diffusion imaging is used to obtain important information about water movements within the architecture of tissues. This is achieved by using MRI sequences specifically designed to  measure the values of the water diffusion coefficient (Diffusion Weighted Imaging) and its components along the 3D space (Diffusion Tensor imaging).\nNeither contrast agents nor specific instrumentation are requested for this kind of experiments.\nDiffusion MRI is used to evaluate the molecular function and micro-architecture of tissues, and it acts as a tool for monitoring treatment response and disease progression for a variety of pathologies such as tumors, white matter diseases, inflammatory diseases and so on.

In the first case, dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC)-MRI, which measures the signal loss in T2- or T2\\*-weighted images, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI, which measures the signal loss in T1-weighted images, are used. In the latter case, arterial spin-labeling (ASL) is used.\nWhile ASL is mainly applied for the measurement of cerebral perfusion, DSC and DCE-MRI are used in a wider variety of clinical applications, including the classification of tumors, stroke regions, and characterization of other diseases, as well as for assessing response to antiangiogenic therapies.\n* Boxerman J.L., et al. \"Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast MR Imaging in Glioma: Review of Current Clinical Practice.\" <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2016.06.005>\n* Sujlana, et al. \"Review of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI: Technical aspects and applications in the musculoskeletal system\", <https://doi.org/10.1002/jmri.25810>\nIn neurology, brain perfusion parameters such as Normalized Cerebral Blood Flow (NCBF) and Cerebral Blood Volume (CBV) are relevant hemodynamic parameters, as their changes can precede abnormalities on conventional MR imaging.

It is typically based on dynamic measurement of brain with BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent) contrast which is achievable with T2\\* weighted images (e.g. GRE EPI). Other contrast principles can be used as well (e.g. blood perfusion). Typical spatial resolution ranges from 3 x 3 x 3 mm to 2 x 2 x 2 mm in whole brain coverage, or even up to 0.1 mm in limited field of view and at ultra-high fields (7T or more). Temporal resolution ranges from 3 s to 0.5 s with EPI sequence.\nfMRI can be used in medical research (and diagnostics) as well as psychology, neuroeconomy, and other disciplines related to understanding human brain and behavior. It is typically used to measure neural activity during tasks or following to stimuli (e.g. scenario with auditory, visual or tactile stimuli distributed during the acquisition time to induce required brain activity), but resting-state fMRI is possible too. It allows to obtain activation maps, evaluate the hemodynamic response in selected regions, estimate the functional connection among brain regions, and evaluate the relationship between activity/connectivity and external variables.\nfMRI can be combined with electrophysiological recordings or stimulation.\nA special case is fMRI hyperscanning (dual fMRI) with two participants measured simultaneously in two scanners.\nExample applications include:\n* localization of brain functions and networks\n* monitoring brain changes caused by stress\n* discovering brain changes in various diseases (e.g. Alzheimer disease, Schizophrenia etc)\n* understanding empathy, emotions and consciousness\n* understanding the learning process\n* observing brain plasticity, development, aging affects\n**Available at:**\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Medical and Preclinicial Imaging Hungary](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n## Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST), Magnetization Transfer (MT) MRI\nIn CEST imaging, a radiofrequency pulse is applied at the resonant frequency(ies) of exchangeable protons in a given molecule or metabolite, in order to reach a saturation state. Chemical exchange of the protons with those of water molecules causes the transfer of magnetic saturation to water over time. The subsequent decrease in water signal is detected by standard MR imaging sequences and provides an indirect measure of the concentration of the species of interest.\nCEST MRI can detect a variety of endogenous small molecules (e.g. glucose, glycogen, lactate, creatine, glutamate), proteins and enzymes for molecular imaging. Development of exogenous CEST agents, including diamagnetic CEST (DIACEST), paramagnetic CEST (PARACEST) and liposome-based (LIPOCEST) agents, greatly enhanced the sensitivity and specificity of CEST imaging (Longo D.L. et al.; “A snapshot of the vast array of diamagnetic CEST MRI contrast agents” <https://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.4715>; Ferrauto G. et al.; “LipoCEST and cellCEST imaging agents: opportunities and challenges” <https://doi.org/10.1002/wnan.1385>).\nCEST imaging can provide information on tissue pH, temperature, oxygenation, metabolism, enzymatic reactions as well as for molecular imaging applications. Example applications include several disorders such as acute stroke, renal injury, tumors and multiple sclerosis.\n![](upload/chemicalmri.png)\nApplication of MRI-CEST tumor pH imaging for assessing response to novel anticancer therapies.

The MT contrast is different from T1, T2, and PD, and it likely reflects the structural integrity of the tissue being imaged. Applications include tissue characterization, such as evaluation of multiple sclerosis and other white-matter lesions and in tumors.\nSee also: van Zijl PCM et al.; “Magnetization Transfer Contrast and Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer MRI.

Since the molecular concentrations of these metabolites are at least 10.000 times lower than water, they produce correspondingly much lower signal strengths. Thus, to detect enough signal above noise for quantification, 1H-MRSI must use much larger voxel sizes in comparison to MRI, leading to lower spatial resolution with respect to anatomical imaging. The use of high magnetic fields allows to overcome this issue.\nMRSI is used in the clinics for quantifying metabolic abnormalities in the human brain, prostate, breast and other organs.\nSee for example:\n* T.A.A. Boroeders et al., “Glutamate levels across deep brain structures in patients with a psychotic disorder and its relation with cognitive functioning”, [http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2021...](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.01.21250977)\n* A.A.

Nevertheless, technological progress, development of acquisition methods and the availability of equipment operating at high magnetic fields have made in vivo heteronuclear MRI/MRS possible in both humans and small animals despite sensitivity limitation, widening the number of applications and the range of metabolites that can be mapped by MRS.\nSodium (23Na) MRI has been applied in a large variety of biomedical/clinical research areas. Sodium ions (Na+) play an important role in many cellular physiological processes. An unbalanced concentration gradient across the cell membranes or an increase in the intracellular Na+ content is an early marker of cell viability in many disease processes. 23Na-MRI can be used for studying heart diseases, by exploiting the increase in the extracellular sodium signal in acute ischemia, for cancer investigations, by measuring the increase of sodium content in proliferating cells, and for testing therapies by evaluating the intracellular sodium accumulation due to cell death <https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jacr.2007.07.001>).\n31P MRS can be used to study the energetic metabolism of a wide range of tissues such as muscle, heart, liver, and kidney in various pathological contexts. Using the endogenous 31P signal arising from the tissue, it is possible to obtain information about the energy status and also determine the intracellular pH (from the chemical shift of Pi). 31P signals from inorganic phosphate, adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, creatine phosphate and sugar phosphates can be observed in whole-cell preparations, intact tissues or organs. Phosphate metabolites that are involved in ATP production and utilization can be quantified non-invasively by 31P-MRS/MRI, while 31P magnetization transfer (MT) techniques allow in vivo measurement of metabolic fluxes via creatine kinase (CK) and ATP synthase (<https://doi.org/10.21037%2Fqims.2017.11.03>).\nFor 13C-MRI, hyperpolarized probes are usually used in order to increase the sensitivity of the technique (see Hyperpolarized MRI).\n19F MRI is increasingly emerging as a multi-nuclear (1H/19F) technique that can be exploited for several purposes, e.g. cell tracking, detection of active inflammation, measuring tissue oxygenation and to study fluorinated pharmaceuticals. The lack of a 19F background signal in tissues affords an unequivocal detection suitable for quantification. Fluorine-based contrast agents can be engineered as nanoemulsions, nanocapsules, or nanoparticles to label cells in vitro or in vivo. Multispectral 19F-MRI using different fluorinated compounds could be also used to detect different labeled cells simultaneously. Specific fluorinated products can be used to map pO2 heterogeneity in tissues.

This is particularly true for nuclei other than protons. Hyperpolarized probes are molecules where the nuclei polarization has been artificially raised. Conversely to standard MRI contrast agents, which act on the relaxation of water protons, hyperpolarized molecules are themselves the source of the NMR signal, thus yielding to signal intensity and SNR that linearly depend upon their concentration and polarization level. Long relaxation times of the hyperpolarized nuclei are essential in order to preserve the polarization for as long as possible. For this reason HP-MRI relies on the detection of heteronuclei rather than protons. For most applications 13C-probes are used.\nThe use of hyperpolarized probes allows to obtain very strong signal enhancements, thus overcoming the MR sensitivity issue and making the detection of low concentration biological molecules possible. Hyperpolarized probes are usually employed for perfusion studies and for mapping metabolites and their transformations through MRS in the body. Hyperpolarized metabolic imaging is particularly useful for the early diagnosis of cancer and monitoring of treatments efficacy because it can reveal changes that happen well before the onset of macroscopic signs of the disease. A typical example is the monitoring of pyruvate and lactate levels after injection of hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate.\nOther examples of applications in the preclinical and clinical fields can be found in the following reviews:\n* Z.J.

A difference in respect to MRI of other body regions is that cardiac and respiratory motions cause artifacts. Thus, CMR requires synchronous cardiac and respiratory gating or breath-holding techniques. Cardiac synchronization with ECG is often used to “freeze” the hearth during MR acquisition.\nMRI can also be used to record movies of the cardiac cycle that permit the extraction of a good number of dynamic cardiac parameters (cine MRI).\nFor more details on CMR techniques and applications see:\n* W.-Y.I.

MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields, radiofrequency pulses, and field gradients to generate images of soft tissues throughout the body.**\nContrast agents based on paramagnetic compounds are commonly used to enhance the signal/noise ratio and assess vascularization or tissue permeability. More recently,  novel classes of contrast agents have been developed, such as hyperpolarized molecules for high sensitivity metabolic studies, or CEST agents for accurate pH parametric imaging.\nMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) can be used to complement MRI in the characterization of tissues. While MRI makes use of water proton signals to create images, MRS uses either proton or heteronuclei signals to determine the relative concentrations of metabolites within a specific organ/tissue.\nMRI scanners at high magnetic fields have the advantage to significantly increase the sensitivity and thus improve the image resolution and scan duration. MRS also benefits from high magnetic fields with an increased spectral resolution, which improves the separation between different chemical components. Nowadays, scanners at 3-7 Tesla are commonly used for both humans and animals, but for small-medium animal studies high field scanners operating at 7-9.4T are also quite common. Ultra-high field MR systems with fields of up to 17 T are also available mainly for preclinical studies.\nIn microMRI/MRS, the instruments are technically optimized for small animal studies, providing resolution in the mm to µm range.\nMRI, either as a single modality or paired to other imaging modalities, is largely used for *in vivo* (humans and animals) studies and also for ex-vivo analysis of specimens (organs or tissue samples).\nIn preclinical imaging, animal models of various pathologies, from tumors to cardiovascular, neurological or metabolic disorders, are commonly used to monitor disease development and to test the efficacy of therapeutic treatments, to develop novel diagnostic tools etc. Several quantitative imaging biomarkers can be used to monitor disease progression over time.\nAnimal imaging can also be used for veterinary studies.\nAt clinical level, MRI is generally a key tool for the diagnosis of various pathologies and for monitoring the efficacy of new therapies. It is also commonly used in studies involving healthy volunteers to evaluate metabolism or functions.\nMRI comprises a large number of techniques for various applications ranging from simple morphological measurements throughout all organs to the evaluation of complex systems, functions, and processes in living organisms.\n**Preclinical and ex-vivo MRI**is provided by the following Nodes:\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed - DIMP NEUROMED](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Facility of Multimodal Imaging - AMMI Maastricht (NL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/facility-of-excellence-in-imaging---alm-and-molecular-imaging-node-maastricht)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Medical and Preclinical Imaging Hungary (HU)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Population Imaging Node Valencia (ES)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/population-imaging-valencia)\n* [Preclinical Imaging Centre (PRIME) - Molecular Imaging Dutch Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node)\n* [NORMOLIM, Norwegian Molecular Imaging Infrastructure](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)\n**Human MRI** is provided by the following Nodes:\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Population Imaging Node Valencia (ES)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/population-imaging-valencia)\n### Use cases\nClick here for\n[Use Cases](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/preclinical-and-medical-imaging-technologies-use-cases-from-our-nodes/) from our Nodes.\n## Anatomical, volumetric, morphometric MRI\nContrast in MRI images is generated by the differences in the nuclear relaxation times of water protons (T1 and T2) across tissues. The image contrast can be controlled by changing the values of specific acquisition parameters, generally the echo time (TE) and the repetition time (TR). Depending on their values, it is possible to obtain images where the contrast and brightness are predominantly determined by the T1 or T2 properties of water in tissues (T1-weighted and T2-weighted images respectively).\nContrast agents are frequently administered to enhance the contrast for assessment of organ functions (perfusion, vascularity, permeability) or better delineation of specific lesions or tissues. Mainly Gd based molecules are used with the acquisition of T1-weighted images and for specific cases iron Oxides could be used with T2-weighted images.\nThe acquisition of anatomical MR images is done with the scope of obtaining detailed morphological information ( shape, size, volume, texture…) of various body regions or lesions (e.g. tumors, ischemia, cysts etc) and to monitor disease progression or regression.\n* Kinnunen K. M., et al. \"Volumetric MRI-Based Biomarkers in Huntington's Disease: An Evidentiary Review\", <https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.712555>\n* McCarthy J., et al. \"Morphometric MRI as a diagnostic biomarker of frontotemporal dementia: A systematic review to determine clinical applicability\", <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2018.08.028>\nWhile MR images are typically assessed in a qualitative way, MRI can collect quantitative information about tissue properties. The range of properties includes the magnetic resonance (MR) relaxation times T1 and T2, T2\\*, diffusion, perfusion, fat and water fractions, iron fraction, elastic properties of tissue, temperature, chemical composition, and chemical exchange, just to mention some. Of note, new MRI methods are constantly being developed. By using the sensitivity of MRI to these tissue properties, it is possible to generate quantitative maps instead of qualitative anatomical images, where the intensity of each pixel corresponds to a measurement of one specific physical or physiological property. Quantitative measurements could help not only for identifying anatomical abnormalities but also for detecting initial loss of function or tissue alteration.\n[Use cases](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/content/use-cases/#volumetric)\n**Available at:**\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed - DIMP NEUROMED](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Facility of Multimodal Imaging - AMMI Maastricht (NL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/facility-of-excellence-in-imaging---alm-and-molecular-imaging-node-maastricht)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Medical and Preclinical Imaging Hungary (HU)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Preclinical Imaging Centre (PRIME) - Molecular Imaging Dutch Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node)\n* [NORMOLIM, Norwegian Molecular Imaging Infrastructure](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Medical and Preclinicial Imaging Hungary](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n## Relaxation mapping - T1, T2, T2\\*, spin-lock MR techniques\nThe signal intensity in  MR images is  a function of water content, tissue properties and of MRI acquisition parameters.\nFor quantitative MR imaging, tissue relaxation times are measured by extracting the signal exponential decay (T2 or T2\\*) or recovery (T1) from multiple measurements.  T1, T2 and/or T1rho parametric images can be acquired.\nThe quantification of relaxation times provides more detailed information on the tissue characteristics (tumor cells invasion, ischemic lesions, vascular leakage, iron deposition, inflammation etc), thus supporting the clinicians in the diagnostic process. Furthermore, relaxation maps are used to quantitatively assess the presence of exogenous contrast agents.\nExample applications:\n* Evaluation of the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix in cartilage (T.J. Moshet et al., “Cartilage MRI T2 Relaxation Time Mapping: Overview and Applications” Seminars in Musculoskeletal Radiology, 2004, 8, 355) and of myocardial pathologies (<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcmg.2013.05.005>).\n* Detection of initial nerve degeneration in ALS (N.

Diffusion imaging is used to obtain important information about water movements within the architecture of tissues. This is achieved by using MRI sequences specifically designed to  measure the values of the water diffusion coefficient (Diffusion Weighted Imaging) and its components along the 3D space (Diffusion Tensor imaging).\nNeither contrast agents nor specific instrumentation are requested for this kind of experiments.\nDiffusion MRI is used to evaluate the molecular function and micro-architecture of tissues, and it acts as a tool for monitoring treatment response and disease progression for a variety of pathologies such as tumors, white matter diseases, inflammatory diseases and so on.

In the first case, dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC)-MRI, which measures the signal loss in T2- or T2\\*-weighted images, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI, which measures the signal loss in T1-weighted images, are used. In the latter case, arterial spin-labeling (ASL) is used.\nWhile ASL is mainly applied for the measurement of cerebral perfusion, DSC and DCE-MRI are used in a wider variety of clinical applications, including the classification of tumors, stroke regions, and characterization of other diseases, as well as for assessing response to antiangiogenic therapies.\n* Boxerman J.L., et al. \"Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast MR Imaging in Glioma: Review of Current Clinical Practice.\" <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2016.06.005>\n* Sujlana, et al. \"Review of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI: Technical aspects and applications in the musculoskeletal system\", <https://doi.org/10.1002/jmri.25810>\nIn neurology, brain perfusion parameters such as Normalized Cerebral Blood Flow (NCBF) and Cerebral Blood Volume (CBV) are relevant hemodynamic parameters, as their changes can precede abnormalities on conventional MR imaging. Thus, knowledge of whether a lesion identified in anatomic images is associated with increased or decreased CBF or CBV can frequently help narrow the differential diagnosis.\n![](upload/asl-mrileft.png)\n![](upload/asl-mriright.png)\nMR images (A) and parameter maps calculated from data of both dynamic susceptibility-contrast MRI (B), and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (C), obtained from a patient with anaplastic astrocytoma in the frontal lobe of the brain.

It is typically based on dynamic measurement of brain with BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent) contrast which is achievable with T2\\* weighted images (e.g. GRE EPI). Other contrast principles can be used as well (e.g. blood perfusion). Typical spatial resolution ranges from 3 x 3 x 3 mm to 2 x 2 x 2 mm in whole brain coverage, or even up to 0.1 mm in limited field of view and at ultra-high fields (7T or more). Temporal resolution ranges from 3 s to 0.5 s with EPI sequence.\nfMRI can be used in medical research (and diagnostics) as well as psychology, neuroeconomy, and other disciplines related to understanding human brain and behavior. It is typically used to measure neural activity during tasks or following to stimuli (e.g. scenario with auditory, visual or tactile stimuli distributed during the acquisition time to induce required brain activity), but resting-state fMRI is possible too. It allows to obtain activation maps, evaluate the hemodynamic response in selected regions, estimate the functional connection among brain regions, and evaluate the relationship between activity/connectivity and external variables.\nfMRI can be combined with electrophysiological recordings or stimulation.\nA special case is fMRI hyperscanning (dual fMRI) with two participants measured simultaneously in two scanners.\nExample applications include:\n* localization of brain functions and networks\n* monitoring brain changes caused by stress\n* discovering brain changes in various diseases (e.g. Alzheimer disease, Schizophrenia etc)\n* understanding empathy, emotions and consciousness\n* understanding the learning process\n* observing brain plasticity, development, aging affects\n**Available at:**\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Medical and Preclinicial Imaging Hungary](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n## Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST), Magnetization Transfer (MT) MRI\nIn CEST imaging, a radiofrequency pulse is applied at the resonant frequency(ies) of exchangeable protons in a given molecule or metabolite, in order to reach a saturation state. Chemical exchange of the protons with those of water molecules causes the transfer of magnetic saturation to water over time. The subsequent decrease in water signal is detected by standard MR imaging sequences and provides an indirect measure of the concentration of the species of interest.\nCEST MRI can detect a variety of endogenous small molecules (e.g. glucose, glycogen, lactate, creatine, glutamate), proteins and enzymes for molecular imaging. Development of exogenous CEST agents, including diamagnetic CEST (DIACEST), paramagnetic CEST (PARACEST) and liposome-based (LIPOCEST) agents, greatly enhanced the sensitivity and specificity of CEST imaging (Longo D.L. et al.; “A snapshot of the vast array of diamagnetic CEST MRI contrast agents” <https://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.4715>; Ferrauto G. et al.; “LipoCEST and cellCEST imaging agents: opportunities and challenges” <https://doi.org/10.1002/wnan.1385>).\nCEST imaging can provide information on tissue pH, temperature, oxygenation, metabolism, enzymatic reactions as well as for molecular imaging applications. Example applications include several disorders such as acute stroke, renal injury, tumors and multiple sclerosis.\n![](upload/chemicalmri.png)\nApplication of MRI-CEST tumor pH imaging for assessing response to novel anticancer therapies.

The MT contrast is different from T1, T2, and PD, and it likely reflects the structural integrity of the tissue being imaged.

Since the molecular concentrations of these metabolites are at least 10.000 times lower than water, they produce correspondingly much lower signal strengths. Thus, to detect enough signal above noise for quantification, 1H-MRSI must use much larger voxel sizes in comparison to MRI, leading to lower spatial resolution with respect to anatomical imaging. The use of high magnetic fields allows to overcome this issue.\nMRSI is used in the clinics for quantifying metabolic abnormalities in the human brain, prostate, breast and other organs.\nSee for example:\n* T.A.A. Boroeders et al., “Glutamate levels across deep brain structures in patients with a psychotic disorder and its relation with cognitive functioning”, [http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2021...](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.01.21250977)\n* A.A.

Nevertheless, technological progress, development of acquisition methods and the availability of equipment operating at high magnetic fields have made in vivo heteronuclear MRI/MRS possible in both humans and small animals despite sensitivity limitation, widening the number of applications and the range of metabolites that can be mapped by MRS.\nSodium (23Na) MRI has been applied in a large variety of biomedical/clinical research areas. Sodium ions (Na+) play an important role in many cellular physiological processes. An unbalanced concentration gradient across the cell membranes or an increase in the intracellular Na+ content is an early marker of cell viability in many disease processes. 23Na-MRI can be used for studying heart diseases, by exploiting the increase in the extracellular sodium signal in acute ischemia, for cancer investigations, by measuring the increase of sodium content in proliferating cells, and for testing therapies by evaluating the intracellular sodium accumulation due to cell death <https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jacr.2007.07.001>).\n31P MRS can be used to study the energetic metabolism of a wide range of tissues such as muscle, heart, liver, and kidney in various pathological contexts. Using the endogenous 31P signal arising from the tissue, it is possible to obtain information about the energy status and also determine the intracellular pH (from the chemical shift of Pi). 31P signals from inorganic phosphate, adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, creatine phosphate and sugar phosphates can be observed in whole-cell preparations, intact tissues or organs. Phosphate metabolites that are involved in ATP production and utilization can be quantified non-invasively by 31P-MRS/MRI, while 31P magnetization transfer (MT) techniques allow in vivo measurement of metabolic fluxes via creatine kinase (CK) and ATP synthase (<https://doi.org/10.21037%2Fqims.2017.11.03>).\nFor 13C-MRI, hyperpolarized probes are usually used in order to increase the sensitivity of the technique (see Hyperpolarized MRI).\n19F MRI is increasingly emerging as a multi-nuclear (1H/19F) technique that can be exploited for several purposes, e.g. cell tracking, detection of active inflammation, measuring tissue oxygenation and to study fluorinated pharmaceuticals. The lack of a 19F background signal in tissues affords an unequivocal detection suitable for quantification. Fluorine-based contrast agents can be engineered as nanoemulsions, nanocapsules, or nanoparticles to label cells in vitro or in vivo. Multispectral 19F-MRI using different fluorinated compounds could be also used to detect different labeled cells simultaneously. Specific fluorinated products can be used to map pO2 heterogeneity in tissues.

This is particularly true for nuclei other than protons. Hyperpolarized probes are molecules where the nuclei polarization has been artificially raised. Conversely to standard MRI contrast agents, which act on the relaxation of water protons, hyperpolarized molecules are themselves the source of the NMR signal, thus yielding to signal intensity and SNR that linearly depend upon their concentration and polarization level. Long relaxation times of the hyperpolarized nuclei are essential in order to preserve the polarization for as long as possible. For this reason HP-MRI relies on the detection of heteronuclei rather than protons. For most applications 13C-probes are used.\nThe use of hyperpolarized probes allows to obtain very strong signal enhancements, thus overcoming the MR sensitivity issue and making the detection of low concentration biological molecules possible. Hyperpolarized probes are usually employed for perfusion studies and for mapping metabolites and their transformations through MRS in the body. Hyperpolarized metabolic imaging is particularly useful for the early diagnosis of cancer and monitoring of treatments efficacy because it can reveal changes that happen well before the onset of macroscopic signs of the disease. A typical example is the monitoring of pyruvate and lactate levels after injection of hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate.\nOther examples of applications in the preclinical and clinical fields can be found in the following reviews:\n* Z.J. Wang et al., Hyperpolarized 13C MRI: State of the Art and Future Directions, [https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol...](https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2019182391)\n* V.Z.

R., et al. \"Introduction to Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping and Susceptibility Weighted Imaging\", <https://doi.org/10.1259/bjr.20181016>\n**Available at:**\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n## Cardiovascular MRI (CMR)\nCardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) comprises a number of MRI techniques designed to assess various aspects of cardiac and vascular function, from cardiovascular morphology to ventricular function, myocardial perfusion, flow quantification and monitoring of coronary artery disease. A difference in respect to MRI of other body regions is that cardiac and respiratory motions cause artifacts. Thus, CMR requires synchronous cardiac and respiratory gating or breath-holding techniques. Cardiac synchronization with ECG is often used to “freeze” the hearth during MR acquisition.\nMRI can also be used to record movies of the cardiac cycle that permit the extraction of a good number of dynamic cardiac parameters (cine MRI).\nFor more details on CMR techniques and applications see:\n* W.-Y.I. Tseng et al., “Introduction to Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance: Technical Principles and Clinical Applications”, <https://doi.org/10.6515%2FACS20150616A>\n* Saeed M., Van T.

For instance, it can be applied to assess the decrease of ejection fraction (EF%) in the heart upon multiple administrations of Doxorubicin for cancer treatment.\n![](upload/CMR.png)\nMRI of heart in diastole or systole for ctrl untreated mice and mice treated with doxorubicin.

Development and application of these techniques has been pioneered in medicinal and pharmacological research. MSI has allowed, for instance, the detection of novel clinical markers for better diagnosis of cancer tissues and to follow the spatial-temporal patterns of drug molecules used for pharmacological studies at cellular resolution.**\nDifferent versions of MSI approaches exist. All of them represent surface analysis techniques which are based on desorption and ionization of molecules followed by their subsequent MS data recording. After collecting a mass spectrum at one spot, the sample is moved to the neighboring spot, and the mass spectrum is sampled again, until the entire sample surface is scanned. By choosing a peak (a distinct m/z value) in the resulting spectra that corresponds to the compound of interest, the MS data is used to map its distribution across the sample. This results in pictures of the spatially resolved distribution of a compound pixel by pixel. Each data set contains a gallery of pictures because any peak in each spectrum can be spatially mapped. MSI therefore has the ability to detect thousands of different analytes in a single experiment. Furthermore, MSI can be applied to any kind of surface, polymers, metal or paper, and of course biological tissues, like histological sections or cells, for obtaining e.g. distribution maps of metabolites.\nThe most common technique applied for MSI of metabolites and peptides is MALDI MSI, involving the application of a suitable matrix substance on the surface. Spatial resolution achievable is depending on the chosen ionization technique and ranges from few nm (SIMS) to µm (MALDI, LA, DESI). Despite the fact that MSI has been generally considered a qualitative method, the signal generated by this technique is proportional to the relative abundance of the analyte and therefore, quantification is possible, but challenging.\nExample applications are described here:\n* M.J.J.

Development and application of these techniques has been pioneered in medicinal and pharmacological research. MSI has allowed, for instance, the detection of novel clinical markers for better diagnosis of cancer tissues and to follow the spatial-temporal patterns of drug molecules used for pharmacological studies at cellular resolution.**\nDifferent versions of MSI approaches exist. All of them represent surface analysis techniques which are based on desorption and ionization of molecules followed by their subsequent MS data recording. After collecting a mass spectrum at one spot, the sample is moved to the neighboring spot, and the mass spectrum is sampled again, until the entire sample surface is scanned. By choosing a peak (a distinct m/z value) in the resulting spectra that corresponds to the compound of interest, the MS data is used to map its distribution across the sample. This results in pictures of the spatially resolved distribution of a compound pixel by pixel. Each data set contains a gallery of pictures because any peak in each spectrum can be spatially mapped. MSI therefore has the ability to detect thousands of different analytes in a single experiment. Furthermore, MSI can be applied to any kind of surface, polymers, metal or paper, and of course biological tissues, like histological sections or cells, for obtaining e.g. distribution maps of metabolites.\nThe most common technique applied for MSI of metabolites and peptides is MALDI MSI, involving the application of a suitable matrix substance on the surface. Spatial resolution achievable is depending on the chosen ionization technique and ranges from few nm (SIMS) to µm (MALDI, LA, DESI). Despite the fact that MSI has been generally considered a qualitative method, the signal generated by this technique is proportional to the relative abundance of the analyte and therefore, quantification is possible, but challenging.\nExample applications are described here:\n* M.J.J.

One setup uses polychromatic radiation from a Rhodium (20W) X-ray tube for excitation of low-, medium- and high-Z elements. Measurements can be performed in air or vacuum. The fluorescence signal is detected using a Si(Li) detector with an ultrathin window, which extends the detectable elements range from Uranium down to Magnesium or Sodium if in vacuo. Scans can be performed with spatial resolution of about 50 µm.\nA second micro-XRF setup uses focused monochromatic Mo-Ka radiation from a 2 kW Mo anode X-ray tube. The polycapillary optics produces a beam of 15 µm diameter. Measurements can be performed only under ambient conditions, so light elements are not accessible. The monochromatic excitation leads to lower detection limits than polychromatic excitation.\n![XRF_Image](upload/XRF_fig1.png \"XRF_image\")\n*Element distributions in bone carrying bioresorbable Mg implant.*\n![XRF_Image](upload/XRF_fig2.png \"XRF_image\")\n*2D Gd-Lα map from a gallbladder stone.

      "documentation": "PhotoAcoustic Imaging (PAI) - med\\*\n## PhotoAcoustic Imaging (PAI) \\*\n---\n**PhotoAcoustic (or optoacoustic) Imaging (PAI) is a novel but well-established technology that combines optical and ultrasound imaging. Briefly, the technique detects endogenous or exogenous chromophores that are excited through an illumination carried out with pulsed laser light, typically in the Red-NIR range. The non-radiative release of the absorbed energy produces a microheating and a thermoelastic expansion in the chromophore close surrounding, which can generate ultrasound. The acoustic waves are detected by a transducer and transformed into an image.**\nPAI combines the advantages of optical and US imaging technologies. The detection of the US signal makes it possible to achieve an increase of both spatial resolution (micrometric) and penetration depth with respect to optical imaging and reduces scattering phenomena. Other advantages include good sensitivity (comparable to that of optical imaging), safety, cheapness and ease of use.\nA very large number of chromophores can be used to generate PAI contrast: endogenous molecules (e.g. oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin, myoglobin, melanin), exogenous probes (e.g. organic dyes like fluorescein and ICG), nanosystems (e.g. noble metals-containing nanoparticles, quantum dots, carbon nanotubes, etc.) and also fluorescent proteins and gene reporters. Detection of different types of chromophores in the same anatomical region is also feasible.\nAs any tomographic technique, PAI allows to get 3D-high resolution images of soft tissues which provide anatomical, functional, and molecular information. Due to the not optimal penetration depth, PAI is particularly useful for preclinical imaging, whereas in humans it’s use is limited to superficial organs analysis (e.g. palmar vessels detection, breast analysis).\n![](upload/paimed.png)\nPhotoacoustic imaging of palmar vessels (left) and of breast tissue (right).

The simultaneous acquisition of high-resolution\nultrasound images allows the localization of the chromophores’ signals\nto specific anatomical regions.\n**Available at:**\n* [Brain Imaging Network (PT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI) (CZ)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n## Multi-wavelength Mode (2D, 3D) PAI\nIn Multi-Wavelength PAI,  photoacoustic data are acquired at\nmultiple wavelengths in 2D and 3D. The main advantage of multispectral\nimaging is the ability to distinguish optically differing signals from\neach other.\nMulti-Wavelenght PAI can be successfully used to detect multiple dyes\n(e.g. in  nanoparticles) and to monitor accumulation at target\nsites and drug release.\n**Available at:**\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI) (CZ)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n## Spectro Mode PAI\nSpectro Mode consists in the rapid collection of photoacoustic data\nacross the entire wavelength range (680-970 and 1200-2000\\* nm) to\ndetermine the spectral characteristics of a given contrast agent. This\nallows to detect contrast agents in vivo and to distinguish them from\nendogenous absorbers. The \"spectral fingerprint\" collected by this\nmodality can also be saved and used for spectral unmixing in\nsubsequent acquisitions.\nSee for example Bui DT, et al., “Multimodal Contrast Agent Enabling pH\nSensing Based on Organically Functionalized Gold Nanoshells with Mn-Zn\nFerrite Cores”,\n<https://doi.org/10.3390/nano12030428>\n## Oxy-Hemo Mode (2D, 3D) PAI\nThis PAI modality is used for the determination of the oxygen\nsaturation in blood. It is based on the fact that oxy- and\ndeoxyhemoglobin absorb light at different wavelengths, thus allowing\nto generate high resolution parametric maps of the oxygen saturation.\nThese maps can be superimposed to high resolution anatomical images\nand used e.g. for studying hypoxia, ischemia and other functional\nprocesses.\n**Available at:**\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI) (CZ)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n## Photoacoustic ECG-gated Kilohertz Visualization (EKV Mode PAI)\nIn EKV Mode,multiple cardiac cycles are averaged. This allows to\nincrease temporal resolution for photoacoustic imaging, with frame\nrates being increased from about 5 to hundreds of frames/sec. This\nmakes it useful for cardiovascular applications, with the\nvisualization of dynamic changes in the photoacoustic signal over the\nentire cardiac cycle.\n## PAI - Volumetric analysis\nVolumetric analysis is used to quantify the amount of the drug or\ncontrast agent in the specific organ volume. A 3D scan is used for\nthis purpose.\n**Available at:**\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI) (CZ)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)",

Briefly, the technique detects endogenous or exogenous chromophores that are excited through an illumination carried out with pulsed laser light, typically in the Red-NIR range. The non-radiative release of the absorbed energy produces a microheating and a thermoelastic expansion in the chromophore close surroundings, which can generate ultrasound. The acoustic waves are detected by a transducer and transformed into an image.**\nPAI combines the advantages of optical and US imaging technologies. The detection of the US signal makes it possible to achieve an increase of both spatial resolution (micrometric) and penetration depth with respect to optical imaging and reduces scattering phenomena. Other advantages include good sensitivity (comparable to that of optical imaging), safety, cheapness and ease of use.\nA very large number of chromophores can be used to generate PAI contrast: endogenous molecules (e.g. oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin, myoglobin, melanin), exogenous probes (e.g. organic dyes like fluorescein and ICG), nanosystems (e.g. noble metals-containing nanoparticles, quantum dots, carbon nanotubes, etc.) and also fluorescent proteins and gene reporters. Detection of different types of chromophores in the same anatomical region is also feasible.\nAs any tomographic technique, PAI allows to get 3D-high resolution images of soft tissues which provide anatomical, functional, and molecular information. Due to the not optimal penetration depth, PAI is particularly useful for preclinical imaging, whereas in humans it’s use is limited to superficial organs analysis (e.g. palmar vessels detection, breast analysis). The most important in vivo application of PAI is the detection of blood hemoglobin, which provides a different PA signal depending on its deoxy- or oxy-state, allowing it to evaluate the vascular volume and pO2 in normal and hypoxic conditions.\nOther applications in the preclinical biomedical field include, but are not limited to:\n* oncology (cancer detection, assessment of vascular volume and hypoxia, targeting experiments, assessment of drug distribution and therapy outcome)\n* neurobiology (stroke, brain cancer, intracranial injection of drugs, functional imaging)\n* cardiovascular biology (heart attack, detection of atherosclerotic plaques, hemodynamic and O2 perfusion)\n* in developmental biology (vascular volume and oxygenation of placenta, image-guided embryo injection, fetal analysis)\n* abdomen analysis (kidney diseases as renal microcirculation flow, renal obstruction analysis, gastrointestinal motility, organs’ perfusion)\n* skin analysis (mainly detection of melanin in melanoma cells)\n* image-guided injection of drug",

QPI operates on unlabelled specimens and, as such, is complementary to established fluorescence microscopy, exhibiting lower phototoxicity and no photobleaching. QPI is a label-free technique in which various methods (for example off-axis digital holography, wavefront sensing, spatial light interference, ptychography) are used to retrieve the phase information of light passing through the cell. In contrast to traditional qualitative label-free techniques such as phase contrast or DIC, QPI measures the absolute phase delay and is high-contrast. In 2D acquisitions the images represent quantitative maps of optical path length delays introduced by the specimen, which correspond to differences between refractive index of the cellular components and medium, and the length of the optical path within the cell. The phase delay can be directly converted into a dry mass of the cell. In 3D acquisition a spatial distribution of refractive indices is obtained, giving a three-dimensional shape of the cell and its compartments.**\nQPI provides an objective measure of morphology and dynamics, free of variability due to contrast agents not used. QPI data are suitable for image segmentation, making label-free cell counting and tracking easy.\nApplication areas:\nThe interpretation of the phase signal has proven to deliver novel parameters for studying physiological processes in living cells, such as transmembrane fluid flux, dry mass and water content changes, intracellular transport as well as tissue structure and density changes. Protein concentrations, growth and cell motility can be precisely quantified. The morphologies of cells and organelles can be established by phase tomography. Their studies provide information on the biomechanical characteristics of cell structures and membranes. These data are indicative of biomolecular activity, which can be affected by pathology.",

The unifying principle behind them is that a large series of individual images is acquired, in each of which only a small subset of the fluorescent labels in the sample are fluorescing. This sparse nature of the signal allows the computational calculation of the exact position of each of the emitting fluorophores. By combining the large number of images with precise locations, an image with very high resolution can be formed.\nBelow are descriptions of some of the common SMLM techniques.\nThe fundamental principle behind stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) is that the activated state of a photo-switchable molecule must lead to the consecutive emission of sufficient photons to enable precise localization before it enters a dark state or becomes deactivated by photobleaching. Additionally, the sparsely activated fluorescent molecules must be separated by a distance that exceeds the Abbe diffraction limit (in effect, greater than approximately 250 nanometers) to enable the parallel recording of many individual emitters, each having a distinct set of coordinates in the lateral image plane.\nPhoto activated localization microscopy (PALM) is a widefield fluorescence microscopy imaging methods that allow obtaining images with a resolution beyond the diffraction limit. PALM is based on collecting a large number of images each containing just a few active isolated fluorophores. The imaging sequence allows for the many emission cycles necessary to stochastically activate each fluorophore from a non-emissive state to a bright state, and back to a bleached state. During each cycle, the density of activated molecules is kept low enough that the molecular images of individual fluorophores do not typically overlap.\nGround state depletion microscopy followed by individual molecule return (GSDIM or GSD for short) is a super-resolution technique based on single molecule localization. To precisely localize single molecules and create a high-resolution image the ensemble of overlapping fluorophores are temporally \"separated\". This can be achieved by using high power lasers to transfer fluorophores into long-lived \"off states\" – a non-fluorescent molecule state. Single fluorophores return stochastically from the off state and emit bursts of photons, which are recorded. The position of the fluorophore is determined using a software algorithm. Based on this list of coordinates a super-resolution image is reconstructed.**",

SIM is a camera based widefield fluorescence microscope employing a patterned illumination, e.g. stripes, to excite the fluorescence in the sample. The diffraction limited structured illumination pattern is the key element that allows to extract higher frequencies from the sample and thus achieve the improved spatial resolution. To obtain one super-resolution image, several images with shifted and rotated illumination patterns projected on the sample are acquired. The set of acquired images is then mathematically processed to reconstruct the super-resolution image. The reachable resolution improvement, both laterally and axially, is twice as better as with conventional widefield microscopy for the same wavelength. Data acquisition for one super-resolution SIM image takes from hundreds of milliseconds to seconds.**\nSIM is a versatile super-resolution technique used for a detailed imaging of cellular structures within cell monolayers or thin tissue sections. The strength of the method lies in the compatibility with a high number of standard fluorophores allowing relatively simple multi-color imaging, and in live-cell imaging friendliness in terms of acquisition speed and used laser powers (phototoxicity) . The downside of SIM compared to other super-resolution techniques (STED, SMLM) is a moderate resolution improvement and proneness to image artifacts formation.\nThere are different realizations of SIM microscopes. Euro-BioImaging nodes offer 2D-SIM, 3D-SIM and TIRF-SIM modalities on commercial setups including DeltaVision OMX, Nikon N-SIM and Carl Zeiss Elyra PS1 systems, which all use sinusoidal striped illumination.\n![](upload/SIM1.png)\n**The principle of conventional light microscopy and structurally illuminated microscopy.** To collect sufficient information, 15 structurally illuminated images in 3 angles and 5 translations per angle are acquired for 1 final reconstructed image in one particular Z-position. The reconstruction of the super-resolution (SR) image is performed in Fourier space (after Fourier transformation (Ft)) when the SR contribution from all 15 images are extracted and aligned back to the newly formed Fourier information. Then, the reverse Fourier transform (rFt) gives the final SR image.\n![](upload/SIM2.png)\n**Examples of images obtained by conventional widefield fluorescence microscopy (left) and structured illumination microscopy (right).** SIM image clearly shows improved resolution. The images of actin (green) and mitochondria (red) are presented as maximum intensity projections and were acquired on DeltaVision OMX microscope (Institute of Molecular Genetics, Czech Republic).",

In addition, the very long wavelength (a fraction of a millimeter) makes it possible to strongly limit scattering processes due to the presence of small particles in the sample.\nIn contrast, this radiation is strongly absorbed by some molecules and, in particular, by water. This is why it is an ideal technology for observing both dry objects and very thin objects. Plant leaves are elements that are very well observed in this region.\nThis method makes it possible to monitor the amount of water in the leaves or major leaf districts, even on the same leaf as a function of time. This allows, for example, early detection of any signs of leaf water stress to enable precision irrigation. See for example: “[Non-invasive absolute measurement of leaf water content using terahertz quantum cascade lasers](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13007-017-0197-z)”\nIn addition, the method is suitable, for example, to study the effect of the presence of ozone in the air on the plants or the interaction with hormones such as abscisic acid (ABA).\nMoreover, it has been used for the quality assessment of dry fruits like chestnuts and hazelnuts.

A TIRF microscope uses an evanescent wave to selectively illuminate and excite fluorophores in a restricted region of the specimen immediately adjacent to the glass-water interface. The evanescent wave is generated only when the incident light is totally internally reflected at the glass-water interface. The evanescent electromagnetic field decays exponentially from the interface, and thus penetrates to a depth of only approximately 100 nm into the sample medium. Thus the TIRF microscope enables a selective visualization of surface regions such as the basal plasma membrane (which are about 7.5 nm thick) of cells. This technique is often used also for observing molecular dynamics in vitro, or study the details of cell locomotion or adhesion to substrata.",

It uses pulsed red-shifted excitation laser light, which can also excite visible fluorescent dyes. However, for each excitation, two (or three) photons of low energy infrared light are absorbed “simultaneously” to provide the required energy for electrons in the fluorophore to reach the excited state. Using infrared light minimizes scattering in the tissue and allows imaging deeper than is possible with common confocal microscopes. Due to the localized multiphoton absorption effect, the background signal is strongly suppressed and a pinhole is not required in front of the detector (PMTs). Both effects lead to an increased penetration depth for these microscopes. Two-photon microscopy is often used to image intravitally, and it may facilitate imaging of unlabelled tissues, using autofluorescence or SHG (second harmonic generation).**",

      "documentation": "ex-vivo micro-CT\n## X-rays Computed Tomography (CT)\n---\n**X-rays Computed Tomography (CT) makes use of X-ray images (projections) taken from different angles and image reconstruction techniques to produce anatomic cross-sectional (tomographic) 3D  images. CT contrast agents (usually based on Iodine, Barium, Gold) can be used to enhance the contrast.**\nIn microCT, the instrumentation is implemented with accessories or with a technical set-up which provides optimum resolution and sensitivity for small animal studies.\nThe spatial resolution of microCT is higher with respect to clinical CT and typically the voxel size is lower than 100 mm for *in vivo* imaging and even smaller (less than 10 mm) for *ex-vivo* sample imaging. In order to achieve high spatial resolution a microfocus X-ray source is installed on microCT scanners.\nAnother difference with respect to clinical CT scanners is the use of flat panel detectors (FPD) with small pixel sizes (less than 100 mm) instead of curved detectors arrays. The use of a FPD results in a cone beam acquisition geometry. In this case, dedicated image reconstruction algorithms, such as the Feldkamp filtered back projection (FBP) algorithm, are needed.\nPreclinical microCT systems can be stand alone or integrated with other modalities like optical or nuclear medicine imaging in order to perform multimodal imaging.  microCT devices can be also found in small animal radiotherapy systems for animal positioning and treatment planning.\n**At Euro-BioImaging, preclinical and ex-vivo CT is provided by the following Nodes:**\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI) (CZ)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed - DIMP NEUROMED](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Facility of Multimodal Imaging - AMMI Maastricht (NL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/facility-of-excellence-in-imaging---alm-and-molecular-imaging-node-maastricht)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Hungary: Medical and Preclinical Imaging Hungary (HU)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Preclinical Imaging Centre (PRIME) - Molecular Imaging Dutch Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node)\n### Use cases\nClick here for\n[Use Cases](/content/use-cases/#CT) from our Nodes.\n## Dual energy CT\nDual energy CT (DECT) was firstly introduced in 1976 with the main\ngoal of obtaining the photoelectric and Compton components of the\nabsorption coefficients using a polychromatic x-ray beam with\ndifferent energies. These two components are respectively proportional\nto atomic number (Z) and density of the material (r) (R.E. Alvarez and\nE. Macovski, “Energy-selective reconstructions in X-ray computerized\ntomography”,\n<https://doi.org/10.1088/0031-9155/21/5/002>).\nBy using DECT acquisitions it is thus possible to obtain rZ maps to\ngain material-specific information at each voxel as shown in the\nfigure below.\n![](upload/microCT.png)\nDECT imaging enables quantitative, 3D mapping of extrinsic contrast\nagents (iodine, red; gold, green) and soft tissues (gray) (from\n<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmp.2021.07.005>).\nA significant boost of DECT came in 2006 with the introduction of dual\nsource CT. In this case two x-ray tubes operating at different tension\nare orthogonally mounted in the gantry and both high and low tension\nimages are acquired (axial or spiral mode) at the same time, reducing\nartifacts induced by movement (T.G. Flohr et al. “First performance\nevaluation of a dual-source CT (DSCT) system”,\n<https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-005-2919-2>).\n## Photon counting CT\nCurrent CT scanners are mostly based on scintillator energy\nintegrating detectors and it is thus not possible to gain information\nabout the energy of the detected x-ray photons. Photons counting\ndetectors (PCD) were firstly introduced for nuclear medicine imaging\nmodalities and their application for x-ray CT was limited by the low\ndetector rate PCD can handle.  However, considering also the\ndevelopments of DECT, there has been a significant research interest\nin improving their material composition and reading electronics.\nA PCD is made of a semiconductor (e.g. Cadmium Telluride) where the\ninteraction with the incoming x-ray generates positive and negative\ncharges proportional to the energy of the incoming photons. Different\nsignal thresholds corresponding to different energy values can be set\nin order to divide the detected transmitted x-ray spectrum into\ndifferent energy bins.\nThe use of PCD is particularly important for DECT as shown in the\nfigure below, where DECT imaging of a mouse using PCD is presented. In\nthis example, material decomposition into three basis materials was\nperformed.\n![](upload/microCT1.png)\nExample of photon-counting CT in a mouse. Material decomposition was\nperformed into iodine (red), photoelectric effect (PE, green), and\nCompton scattering (gray) (from\n<https://doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0218417>)\n## K-Edge subtraction CT\nIn subtraction X-ray imaging, tissue structures or organs are\nvisualized using a contrast medium and measuring the changes in the\nattenuation between the contrasted structure and the surrounding\ntissue. In K-edge subtraction (KES) imaging, two X-ray images are\ntaken at different mean energies, slightly below and a bit above the\nK-edge of the contrast agent photoelectric absorption. Their\nsubtraction generates an image only displaying the contrasted\nstructure.\nSo far, this method mostly relies on monochromatic X-rays produced at\nlarge synchrotron facilities.\nKES allows to differentiate similarly absorbing substances in contrast\nenhanced CT, such as for example commonly used iodine contrast agents\nand calcium which is typically seen in calcifications, kidney stones\nand bones.\n## Phase contrast CT\nOne of the main limitations of CT is the poor contrast of low Z\nmaterials, e.g. soft tissues, because of similar X-ray absorption. In\norder to solve this problem the diffraction and refraction of the\nX-rays can be exploited to obtain more information about the structure\nof the object. This technique is called Phase Contrast Imaging. See\nPhase Contrast CT Imaging for more information\n[here](/service/phase-contrast-imaging-PCI).",

A variety of bioluminescent and/or fluorescent probes can be used, each targeted to a specific tissue or molecular or cellular event.**\nOptical Imaging is particularly useful for visualizing cells that have been engineered to express reporter genes, provided that they are located not too deep in the body.\nMost preclinical applications are in oncology and neuroscience research, but optical imaging is also used for cardiovascular studies and to monitor gene therapy, infectious diseases, inflammation, metabolic diseases and drug metabolism.\nBioluminescence Imaging of a lung tumor mouse model (courtesy of San Raffaele Hospital, Molecular Imaging Italian Node)\nWithin Euro-BioImaging, preclinical in vivo optical Imaging is provided by the following Nodes:\n[• Austria BioImaging Node / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n[• Brain Imaging Network (PT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n[• Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging, CAPI (CZ)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n[• Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n[• Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n[• Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n[• Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n[• DIMP Neuromed Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed)\n[• Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n[• Medical and Preclinical Imaging Hungary (HU)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n[• NORMOLIM (NO)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)\n[• PRIME Node (NL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node)\n### Use cases\nClick here for\n[Use Cases](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/content/use-cases/#OI) from our Nodes.\n## Fluorescence in vivo Imaging (NIR I, NIR II)\nIn vivo Fluorescence imaging is based on the detection of fluorescence\nemitted by fluorescent reporters either in Near InfraRed I (NIR I,\nwavelength range 700-900 nm) or in Near InfraRed II (NIR II, or SWIR -\nShort Wave InfraRed - wavelength in the range 1000-2000 nm) in living\nlaboratory animals, most usually mice.\nThe NIR I \"optical window\" covers regions where light is not much\nabsorbed by hemoglobin and water, thus allowing the signal coming from\ninner organs to be detected. The low autofluorescence of skin and\nurine results in a good ratio of signal to background.\nFluorescence is usually emitted by NIR I dyes linked to tracked\nmolecules or particles but NIR I proteins have also been developed.\nThe optical window for in vivo optical imaging in NIR II can even\nincrease the benefits with respect to imaging in NIR I. In fact,\nalthough absorption of light by water is higher than in NIR I, lower\nscattering and lower autofluorescence enable the visualization of fine\nstructures such as e.g. blood vessels with a better quality. The\ndrawback of NIR II in vivo imaging is the small number of\nbiocompatible fluorophores and commercially available optical imagers.\nSee also: M. Hassan and B.A. Klaunberg, “Biomedical applications of\nfluorescence imaging in vivo”, [https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/aalas/cm/2004/00000054/00000006/art00006](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/aalas/cm/2004/00000054/00000006/art00006#)\n**Available at:**\n[• CAPI Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n[• Danish BioImaging](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n[• Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n[• Molecular Imaging Italian Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n[• NORMOLIM](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)\n[• Medical and Preclinicial Imaging Hungary](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n## Bioluminescence Imaging (BLI)\nBioluminescence Imaging is based on the detection of light emitted by\nenzymes (e.g. luciferase) transfected (or transducted) to laboratory\ncell lines or animals from other organisms, for example fireflies.\nInteraction of the enzymes with their substrates is needed for light\nemission: for this reason, substrates are injected into the animal or\nadded to cultivation media before the imaging session.\nThe bioluminescence signal is relatively low compared to fluorescence,\nbut the background is limited to digital noise and therefore the signal\nto noise ratio can be excellent. Example applications of BLI are the\ntracking of stem cells or viability of tissues transplanted from animals\nexpressing bioluminescent enzymes into non-luminescent animals, in vivo\nstudies of infection (with bioluminescent pathogens) and cancer\nprogression (e.g. using bioluminescent cancer cell lines).\nSee for example: P.E. Almeida et al., “In vivo bioluminescence for\ntracking cell fate and function”,\n<https://doi.org/10.1152%2Fajpheart.00337.2011>; M. Hutchens and G.D. Luker “Applications of bioluminescence imaging\nto the study of infectious diseases”,\n<https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-5822.2007.00995.x>; N. Alsawaftah et al., “Bioluminescence Imaging Applications in\nCancer: A Comprehensive Review”,\n<https://doi.org/10.1109/rbme.2020.2995124>\nLight can also be produced by chemical reactions in living bodies\n(chemiluminescence). An example is the reaction of luminol with hydrogen\nperoxide which can be used in vivo for the localization of infiltrated\nneutrophils by monitoring the activity of myeloperoxidase (<https://doi.org/10.1038/nm.1886>).\n**Available at:**\n* [CAPI Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [NORMOLIM](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)\n* [Medical and Preclinicial Imaging Hungary](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n## Cerenkov Radiation Imaging and Radio Luminescence Imaging\nCerenkov radiation is a blue light emitted when charged particles (e.g. electrons) move through dielectric materials faster than light. Sensitive optical imagers can localize therapeutic isotopes emitting Cerenkov radiation, for example Yttrium-90 or Terbium-161, in small animals. No significant changes in imaging procedures are required for Cerenkov Imaging, other than replacing injection of a bioluminescent substrate with that of a radiotracer.\nCerenkov and RadioLuminescence Imaging can be used to image the spatial distribution and concentration of therapeutic radionuclides, visualize gene expression, imaging guided surgery at preclinical level.\nSee also:\n* D.L.J.

When light impinges upon layered structures, backscattered light from interfaces in the sample interferes with a reference light beam, forming modulated interferogram, which can in turn lead to the reconstruction of inner structures of biological samples in vivo. By using wideband low coherence light sources, OCT can achieve subcellular spatial resolution as well as high temporal resolution. In addition to structural imaging, an extension of OCT, namely OCT angiography (OCTA), can produce contrast based on speckle or phase variance, which has seen increasing applications in ophthalmology (<https://doi.org/10.1097%2FICU.0b013e32835f8bf8>) and dermatology (<https://doi.org/10.1117/1.jbo.18.6.061224>).\n![](upload/ivoi2.png)\nmicro-OCT Imaging of corneal scar in an animal model (<https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-29761-4>)\nAvailable at:\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Brain Imaging Network](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Danish BioImaging](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n## Imaging guided surgery\nDuring tumor resection, clear differentiation between normal and cancerous tissues is critical for increasing the negative margin rates. The difference in fluorescence intensity between the normal and cancer tissues can be enhanced by the use of fluorescent probes targetting the tumor of interest, making it easier to distinguish cancer tissue from normal tissue during intervention.\nSee for example:\n* K.

      "documentation": "## Intravital microscopy (IVM)\n---\n**Intravital imaging covers a range of microscopy modalities used for the long term imaging of living animal models (e.g. zebrafish larvae, mice, rats), in various organs or tissues, or as a whole for smaller models. Intravital Imaging can be performed using 2-photon microscopy, light-sheet microscopy or others. The choice is usually made based on the required penetration depth and resolution. These techniques can be combined with optical manipulation systems, such as laser ablation or optogenetic manipulation systems, and also with a range of e.g. neurological or behavioral stimuli especially when awake, immobilized animals are imaged.**\nIntravital imaging allows the real-time visualization of cellular processes in their native environment in the living organism. It can be performed as repetitive imaging on the same animal, allowing biological processes to be tracked over long periods of time, or as acute experiments.\nSome Euro-BioImaging Nodes offer Intravital Imaging in direct association with animal houses, which is required especially for chronic or repeated imaging.\nIntravital microscopy is used for a wide variety of applications where dynamic processes in intact tissue environments need to be understood (see the review articles below for a range of examples). These include various analyses of vascular function, following the migration and cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions of e.g. immune cells or invasive/metastatic tumor cells in different tissues, and changes in e.g. neuronal or astrocyte morphology in response to stimulus or injury. Intravital brain imaging is increasingly done in awake rodents, which allows the integration of e.g. sensory cues for analysis of behavioral responses. A constantly increasing variety of functional probes can also be used for intravital microscopy, including calcium indicators, environmental sensors, FRET probes and enzyme-activated probes.\n**REFERENCES.**\n* Pittet M.J., Weissleder R. “Intravital imaging”, <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2011.11.004>\n* Secklehner J. et al. “Intravital microscopy in historic and contemporary immunology”, <https://doi.org/10.1038/icb.2017.25>\n* Coste A. et al. “Intravital Imaging Techniques for Biomedical and Clinical Research”, <https://doi.org/10.1002/cyto.a.23963>\n* Murphy K.J. et al. “Quantifying and visualising the nuances of cellular dynamics in vivo using intravital imaging”<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceb.2021.04.007>\n![](upload/ivmright.png)\n![](upload/ivmleft.png)\n*2-photon intravital microscopy images of living mouse ear skin, captured at the Biomedicum Imaging Unit In Vivo Imaging (BIU-IVI), part of Helsinki In Vivo Animal Imaging Platform (HAIP) in the Finnish Biomedical Imaging (FiBI) EuBI Node.*\n**IVM is available at the following Nodes:**\n* [Advanced Light and Electron Microscopy Node Prague CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-and-electron-microscopy-node-prague-cz)\n* [EMBL Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-facility-embl)\n* [Facility of Multimodal Imaging - AMMI Maastricht](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/facility-of-excellence-in-imaging---alm-and-molecular-imaging-node-maastricht)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [French BioImaging Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/french-bioimaging-node)\n* [Israel BioImaging](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Portuguese Platform of BioImaging PPBI](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/portuguese-platform-of-bioimaging-ppbi)\n* [PRIME Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node)\n* [Swedish National Microscopy Infrastructure NMI](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/swedish-national-microscopy-infrastructure-nmi)\n| Use cases | Node | DOI |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Longitudinal two-photon imaging in somatosensory cortex of behaving mice reveals dendritic spine formation enhancement by subchronic administration of low-dose ketamine | [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node) | <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-24933-8> |",

CT contrast agents (usually based on Iodine, Barium, Gold) can be used to enhance the contrast.**\nIn microCT, the instrumentation is implemented with accessories or with a technical set-up which provides optimum resolution and sensitivity for small animal studies.\nThe spatial resolution of microCT is higher with respect to clinical CT and typically the voxel size is lower than 100 mm for *in vivo* imaging and even smaller (less than 10 mm) for *ex-vivo* sample imaging. In order to achieve high spatial resolution a microfocus X-ray source is installed on microCT scanners.\nAnother difference with respect to clinical CT scanners is the use of flat panel detectors (FPD) with small pixel sizes (less than 100 mm) instead of curved detectors arrays. The use of a FPD results in a cone beam acquisition geometry. In this case, dedicated image reconstruction algorithms, such as the Feldkamp filtered back projection (FBP) algorithm, are needed.\nPreclinical microCT systems can be stand alone or integrated with other modalities like optical or nuclear medicine imaging in order to perform multimodal imaging.  microCT devices can be also found in small animal radiotherapy systems for animal positioning and treatment planning.\n**At Euro-BioImaging, preclinical and ex-vivo CT is provided by the following Nodes:**\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI) (CZ)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed - DIMP NEUROMED](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Facility of Multimodal Imaging - AMMI Maastricht (NL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/facility-of-excellence-in-imaging---alm-and-molecular-imaging-node-maastricht)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Hungary: Medical and Preclinical Imaging Hungary (HU)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Preclinical Imaging Centre (PRIME) - Molecular Imaging Dutch Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node)\n### Use cases\nClick here for\n[Use Cases](/content/use-cases/#CT) from our Nodes.\n## Dual energy CT\nDual energy CT (DECT) was firstly introduced in 1976 with the main\ngoal of obtaining the photoelectric and Compton components of the\nabsorption coefficients using a polychromatic x-ray beam with\ndifferent energies. These two components are respectively proportional\nto atomic number (Z) and density of the material (r) (R.E. Alvarez and\nE. Macovski, “Energy-selective reconstructions in X-ray computerized\ntomography”,\n<https://doi.org/10.1088/0031-9155/21/5/002>).\nBy using DECT acquisitions it is thus possible to obtain rZ maps to\ngain material-specific information at each voxel as shown in the\nfigure below.\n![](upload/microCT.png)\nDECT imaging enables quantitative, 3D mapping of extrinsic contrast\nagents (iodine, red; gold, green) and soft tissues (gray) (from\n<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmp.2021.07.005>).\nA significant boost of DECT came in 2006 with the introduction of dual\nsource CT. In this case two x-ray tubes operating at different tension\nare orthogonally mounted in the gantry and both high and low tension\nimages are acquired (axial or spiral mode) at the same time, reducing\nartifacts induced by movement (T.G. Flohr et al. “First performance\nevaluation of a dual-source CT (DSCT) system”,\n<https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-005-2919-2>).\n## Photon counting CT\nCurrent CT scanners are mostly based on scintillator energy\nintegrating detectors and it is thus not possible to gain information\nabout the energy of the detected x-ray photons. Photons counting\ndetectors (PCD) were firstly introduced for nuclear medicine imaging\nmodalities and their application for x-ray CT was limited by the low\ndetector rate PCD can handle.  However, considering also the\ndevelopments of DECT, there has been a significant research interest\nin improving their material composition and reading electronics.\nA PCD is made of a semiconductor (e.g. Cadmium Telluride) where the\ninteraction with the incoming x-ray generates positive and negative\ncharges proportional to the energy of the incoming photons. Different\nsignal thresholds corresponding to different energy values can be set\nin order to divide the detected transmitted x-ray spectrum into\ndifferent energy bins.\nThe use of PCD is particularly important for DECT as shown in the\nfigure below, where DECT imaging of a mouse using PCD is presented. In\nthis example, material decomposition into three basis materials was\nperformed.\n![](upload/microCT1.png)\nExample of photon-counting CT in a mouse. Material decomposition was\nperformed into iodine (red), photoelectric effect (PE, green), and\nCompton scattering (gray) (from\n<https://doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0218417>)\n## K-Edge subtraction CT\nIn subtraction X-ray imaging, tissue structures or organs are\nvisualized using a contrast medium and measuring the changes in the\nattenuation between the contrasted structure and the surrounding\ntissue. In K-edge subtraction (KES) imaging, two X-ray images are\ntaken at different mean energies, slightly below and a bit above the\nK-edge of the contrast agent photoelectric absorption. Their\nsubtraction generates an image only displaying the contrasted\nstructure.\nSo far, this method mostly relies on monochromatic X-rays produced at\nlarge synchrotron facilities.\nKES allows to differentiate similarly absorbing substances in contrast\nenhanced CT, such as for example commonly used iodine contrast agents\nand calcium which is typically seen in calcifications, kidney stones\nand bones.\n## Phase contrast CT\nOne of the main limitations of CT is the poor contrast of low Z\nmaterials, e.g. soft tissues, because of similar X-ray absorption. In\norder to solve this problem the diffraction and refraction of the\nX-rays can be exploited to obtain more information about the structure\nof the object. This technique is called Phase Contrast Imaging. See\nPhase Contrast CT Imaging for more information\n[here](/service/phase-contrast-imaging-PCI).",

MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields, radiofrequency pulses, and field gradients to generate images of soft tissues throughout the body.**\nContrast agents based on paramagnetic compounds are commonly used to enhance the signal/noise ratio and assess vascularization or tissue permeability. More recently,  novel classes of contrast agents have been developed, such as hyperpolarized molecules for high sensitivity metabolic studies, or CEST agents for accurate pH parametric imaging.\nMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) can be used to complement MRI in the characterization of tissues. While MRI makes use of water proton signals to create images, MRS uses either proton or heteronuclei signals to determine the relative concentrations of metabolites within a specific organ/tissue.\nMRI scanners at high magnetic fields have the advantage to significantly increase the sensitivity and thus improve the image resolution and scan duration. MRS also benefits from high magnetic fields with an increased spectral resolution, which improves the separation between different chemical components. Nowadays, scanners at 3-7 Tesla are commonly used for both humans and animals, but for small-medium animal studies high field scanners operating at 7-9.4T are also quite common. Ultra-high field MR systems with fields of up to 17 T are also available mainly for preclinical studies.\nIn microMRI/MRS, the instruments are technically optimized for small animal studies, providing resolution in the mm to µm range.\nMRI, either as a single modality or paired to other imaging modalities, is largely used for *in vivo* (humans and animals) studies and also for ex-vivo analysis of specimens (organs or tissue samples).\nIn preclinical imaging, animal models of various pathologies, from tumors to cardiovascular, neurological or metabolic disorders, are commonly used to monitor disease development and to test the efficacy of therapeutic treatments, to develop novel diagnostic tools etc. Several quantitative imaging biomarkers can be used to monitor disease progression over time.\nAnimal imaging can also be used for veterinary studies.\nAt clinical level, MRI is generally a key tool for the diagnosis of various pathologies and for monitoring the efficacy of new therapies. It is also commonly used in studies involving healthy volunteers to evaluate metabolism or functions.\nMRI comprises a large number of techniques for various applications ranging from simple morphological measurements throughout all organs to the evaluation of complex systems, functions, and processes in living organisms.\n**Preclinical and ex-vivo MRI**is provided by the following Nodes:\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed - DIMP NEUROMED](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Facility of Multimodal Imaging - AMMI Maastricht (NL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/facility-of-excellence-in-imaging---alm-and-molecular-imaging-node-maastricht)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Medical and Preclinical Imaging Hungary (HU)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Population Imaging Node Valencia (ES)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/population-imaging-valencia)\n* [Preclinical Imaging Centre (PRIME) - Molecular Imaging Dutch Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node)\n* [NORMOLIM, Norwegian Molecular Imaging Infrastructure](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)\n**Human MRI** is provided by the following Nodes:\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Population Imaging Node Valencia (ES)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/population-imaging-valencia)\n### Use cases\nClick here for\n[Use Cases](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/preclinical-and-medical-imaging-technologies-use-cases-from-our-nodes/) from our Nodes.\n## Anatomical, volumetric, morphometric MRI\nContrast in MRI images is generated by the differences in the nuclear relaxation times of water protons (T1 and T2) across tissues. The image contrast can be controlled by changing the values of specific acquisition parameters, generally the echo time (TE) and the repetition time (TR). Depending on their values, it is possible to obtain images where the contrast and brightness are predominantly determined by the T1 or T2 properties of water in tissues (T1-weighted and T2-weighted images respectively).\nContrast agents are frequently administered to enhance the contrast for assessment of organ functions (perfusion, vascularity, permeability) or better delineation of specific lesions or tissues. Mainly Gd based molecules are used with the acquisition of T1-weighted images and for specific cases iron Oxides could be used with T2-weighted images.\nThe acquisition of anatomical MR images is done with the scope of obtaining detailed morphological information ( shape, size, volume, texture…) of various body regions or lesions (e.g. tumors, ischemia, cysts etc) and to monitor disease progression or regression.\n* Kinnunen K. M., et al. \"Volumetric MRI-Based Biomarkers in Huntington's Disease: An Evidentiary Review\", <https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.712555>\n* McCarthy J., et al. \"Morphometric MRI as a diagnostic biomarker of frontotemporal dementia: A systematic review to determine clinical applicability\", <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2018.08.028>\nWhile MR images are typically assessed in a qualitative way, MRI can collect quantitative information about tissue properties. The range of properties includes the magnetic resonance (MR) relaxation times T1 and T2, T2\\*, diffusion, perfusion, fat and water fractions, iron fraction, elastic properties of tissue, temperature, chemical composition, and chemical exchange, just to mention some. Of note, new MRI methods are constantly being developed. By using the sensitivity of MRI to these tissue properties, it is possible to generate quantitative maps instead of qualitative anatomical images, where the intensity of each pixel corresponds to a measurement of one specific physical or physiological property. Quantitative measurements could help not only for identifying anatomical abnormalities but also for detecting initial loss of function or tissue alteration.\n[Use cases](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/content/use-cases/#volumetric)\n**Available at:**\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed - DIMP NEUROMED](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Facility of Multimodal Imaging - AMMI Maastricht (NL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/facility-of-excellence-in-imaging---alm-and-molecular-imaging-node-maastricht)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Medical and Preclinical Imaging Hungary (HU)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Preclinical Imaging Centre (PRIME) - Molecular Imaging Dutch Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node)\n* [NORMOLIM, Norwegian Molecular Imaging Infrastructure](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Medical and Preclinicial Imaging Hungary](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n## Relaxation mapping - T1, T2, T2\\*, spin-lock MR techniques\nThe signal intensity in  MR images is  a function of water content, tissue properties and of MRI acquisition parameters.\nFor quantitative MR imaging, tissue relaxation times are measured by extracting the signal exponential decay (T2 or T2\\*) or recovery (T1) from multiple measurements.  T1, T2 and/or T1rho parametric images can be acquired.\nThe quantification of relaxation times provides more detailed information on the tissue characteristics (tumor cells invasion, ischemic lesions, vascular leakage, iron deposition, inflammation etc), thus supporting the clinicians in the diagnostic process.

Diffusion imaging is used to obtain important information about water movements within the architecture of tissues. This is achieved by using MRI sequences specifically designed to  measure the values of the water diffusion coefficient (Diffusion Weighted Imaging) and its components along the 3D space (Diffusion Tensor imaging).\nNeither contrast agents nor specific instrumentation are requested for this kind of experiments.\nDiffusion MRI is used to evaluate the molecular function and micro-architecture of tissues, and it acts as a tool for monitoring treatment response and disease progression for a variety of pathologies such as tumors, white matter diseases, inflammatory diseases and so on.

In the first case, dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC)-MRI, which measures the signal loss in T2- or T2\\*-weighted images, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI, which measures the signal loss in T1-weighted images, are used. In the latter case, arterial spin-labeling (ASL) is used.\nWhile ASL is mainly applied for the measurement of cerebral perfusion, DSC and DCE-MRI are used in a wider variety of clinical applications, including the classification of tumors, stroke regions, and characterization of other diseases, as well as for assessing response to antiangiogenic therapies.\n* Boxerman J.L., et al. \"Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast MR Imaging in Glioma: Review of Current Clinical Practice.\" <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2016.06.005>\n* Sujlana, et al. \"Review of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI: Technical aspects and applications in the musculoskeletal system\", <https://doi.org/10.1002/jmri.25810>\nIn neurology, brain perfusion parameters such as Normalized Cerebral Blood Flow (NCBF) and Cerebral Blood Volume (CBV) are relevant hemodynamic parameters, as their changes can precede abnormalities on conventional MR imaging.

It is typically based on dynamic measurement of brain with BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent) contrast which is achievable with T2\\* weighted images (e.g. GRE EPI). Other contrast principles can be used as well (e.g. blood perfusion). Typical spatial resolution ranges from 3 x 3 x 3 mm to 2 x 2 x 2 mm in whole brain coverage, or even up to 0.1 mm in limited field of view and at ultra-high fields (7T or more). Temporal resolution ranges from 3 s to 0.5 s with EPI sequence.\nfMRI can be used in medical research (and diagnostics) as well as psychology, neuroeconomy, and other disciplines related to understanding human brain and behavior. It is typically used to measure neural activity during tasks or following to stimuli (e.g. scenario with auditory, visual or tactile stimuli distributed during the acquisition time to induce required brain activity), but resting-state fMRI is possible too. It allows to obtain activation maps, evaluate the hemodynamic response in selected regions, estimate the functional connection among brain regions, and evaluate the relationship between activity/connectivity and external variables.\nfMRI can be combined with electrophysiological recordings or stimulation.\nA special case is fMRI hyperscanning (dual fMRI) with two participants measured simultaneously in two scanners.\nExample applications include:\n* localization of brain functions and networks\n* monitoring brain changes caused by stress\n* discovering brain changes in various diseases (e.g. Alzheimer disease, Schizophrenia etc)\n* understanding empathy, emotions and consciousness\n* understanding the learning process\n* observing brain plasticity, development, aging affects\n**Available at:**\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Medical and Preclinicial Imaging Hungary](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n## Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST), Magnetization Transfer (MT) MRI\nIn CEST imaging, a radiofrequency pulse is applied at the resonant frequency(ies) of exchangeable protons in a given molecule or metabolite, in order to reach a saturation state. Chemical exchange of the protons with those of water molecules causes the transfer of magnetic saturation to water over time. The subsequent decrease in water signal is detected by standard MR imaging sequences and provides an indirect measure of the concentration of the species of interest.\nCEST MRI can detect a variety of endogenous small molecules (e.g. glucose, glycogen, lactate, creatine, glutamate), proteins and enzymes for molecular imaging. Development of exogenous CEST agents, including diamagnetic CEST (DIACEST), paramagnetic CEST (PARACEST) and liposome-based (LIPOCEST) agents, greatly enhanced the sensitivity and specificity of CEST imaging (Longo D.L. et al.; “A snapshot of the vast array of diamagnetic CEST MRI contrast agents” <https://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.4715>; Ferrauto G. et al.; “LipoCEST and cellCEST imaging agents: opportunities and challenges” <https://doi.org/10.1002/wnan.1385>).\nCEST imaging can provide information on tissue pH, temperature, oxygenation, metabolism, enzymatic reactions as well as for molecular imaging applications. Example applications include several disorders such as acute stroke, renal injury, tumors and multiple sclerosis.\n![](upload/chemicalmri.png)\nApplication of MRI-CEST tumor pH imaging for assessing response to novel anticancer therapies.

The MT contrast is different from T1, T2, and PD, and it likely reflects the structural integrity of the tissue being imaged. Applications include tissue characterization, such as evaluation of multiple sclerosis and other white-matter lesions and in tumors.\nSee also: van Zijl PCM et al.; “Magnetization Transfer Contrast and Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer MRI.

Since the molecular concentrations of these metabolites are at least 10.000 times lower than water, they produce correspondingly much lower signal strengths. Thus, to detect enough signal above noise for quantification, 1H-MRSI must use much larger voxel sizes in comparison to MRI, leading to lower spatial resolution with respect to anatomical imaging. The use of high magnetic fields allows to overcome this issue.\nMRSI is used in the clinics for quantifying metabolic abnormalities in the human brain, prostate, breast and other organs.\nSee for example:\n* T.A.A. Boroeders et al., “Glutamate levels across deep brain structures in patients with a psychotic disorder and its relation with cognitive functioning”, [http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2021...](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.01.21250977)\n* A.A.

Nevertheless, technological progress, development of acquisition methods and the availability of equipment operating at high magnetic fields have made in vivo heteronuclear MRI/MRS possible in both humans and small animals despite sensitivity limitation, widening the number of applications and the range of metabolites that can be mapped by MRS.\nSodium (23Na) MRI has been applied in a large variety of biomedical/clinical research areas. Sodium ions (Na+) play an important role in many cellular physiological processes. An unbalanced concentration gradient across the cell membranes or an increase in the intracellular Na+ content is an early marker of cell viability in many disease processes. 23Na-MRI can be used for studying heart diseases, by exploiting the increase in the extracellular sodium signal in acute ischemia, for cancer investigations, by measuring the increase of sodium content in proliferating cells, and for testing therapies by evaluating the intracellular sodium accumulation due to cell death <https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jacr.2007.07.001>).\n31P MRS can be used to study the energetic metabolism of a wide range of tissues such as muscle, heart, liver, and kidney in various pathological contexts. Using the endogenous 31P signal arising from the tissue, it is possible to obtain information about the energy status and also determine the intracellular pH (from the chemical shift of Pi). 31P signals from inorganic phosphate, adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, creatine phosphate and sugar phosphates can be observed in whole-cell preparations, intact tissues or organs. Phosphate metabolites that are involved in ATP production and utilization can be quantified non-invasively by 31P-MRS/MRI, while 31P magnetization transfer (MT) techniques allow in vivo measurement of metabolic fluxes via creatine kinase (CK) and ATP synthase (<https://doi.org/10.21037%2Fqims.2017.11.03>).\nFor 13C-MRI, hyperpolarized probes are usually used in order to increase the sensitivity of the technique (see Hyperpolarized MRI).\n19F MRI is increasingly emerging as a multi-nuclear (1H/19F) technique that can be exploited for several purposes, e.g. cell tracking, detection of active inflammation, measuring tissue oxygenation and to study fluorinated pharmaceuticals. The lack of a 19F background signal in tissues affords an unequivocal detection suitable for quantification. Fluorine-based contrast agents can be engineered as nanoemulsions, nanocapsules, or nanoparticles to label cells in vitro or in vivo. Multispectral 19F-MRI using different fluorinated compounds could be also used to detect different labeled cells simultaneously. Specific fluorinated products can be used to map pO2 heterogeneity in tissues.

This is particularly true for nuclei other than protons. Hyperpolarized probes are molecules where the nuclei polarization has been artificially raised. Conversely to standard MRI contrast agents, which act on the relaxation of water protons, hyperpolarized molecules are themselves the source of the NMR signal, thus yielding to signal intensity and SNR that linearly depend upon their concentration and polarization level. Long relaxation times of the hyperpolarized nuclei are essential in order to preserve the polarization for as long as possible. For this reason HP-MRI relies on the detection of heteronuclei rather than protons. For most applications 13C-probes are used.\nThe use of hyperpolarized probes allows to obtain very strong signal enhancements, thus overcoming the MR sensitivity issue and making the detection of low concentration biological molecules possible. Hyperpolarized probes are usually employed for perfusion studies and for mapping metabolites and their transformations through MRS in the body. Hyperpolarized metabolic imaging is particularly useful for the early diagnosis of cancer and monitoring of treatments efficacy because it can reveal changes that happen well before the onset of macroscopic signs of the disease. A typical example is the monitoring of pyruvate and lactate levels after injection of hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate.\nOther examples of applications in the preclinical and clinical fields can be found in the following reviews:\n* Z.J.

A difference in respect to MRI of other body regions is that cardiac and respiratory motions cause artifacts. Thus, CMR requires synchronous cardiac and respiratory gating or breath-holding techniques. Cardiac synchronization with ECG is often used to “freeze” the hearth during MR acquisition.\nMRI can also be used to record movies of the cardiac cycle that permit the extraction of a good number of dynamic cardiac parameters (cine MRI).\nFor more details on CMR techniques and applications see:\n* W.-Y.I.

MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields, radiofrequency pulses, and field gradients to generate images of soft tissues throughout the body.**\nContrast agents based on paramagnetic compounds are commonly used to enhance the signal/noise ratio and assess vascularization or tissue permeability. More recently,  novel classes of contrast agents have been developed, such as hyperpolarized molecules for high sensitivity metabolic studies, or CEST agents for accurate pH parametric imaging.\nMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) can be used to complement MRI in the characterization of tissues. While MRI makes use of water proton signals to create images, MRS uses either proton or heteronuclei signals to determine the relative concentrations of metabolites within a specific organ/tissue.\nMRI scanners at high magnetic fields have the advantage to significantly increase the sensitivity and thus improve the image resolution and scan duration. MRS also benefits from high magnetic fields with an increased spectral resolution, which improves the separation between different chemical components. Nowadays, scanners at 3-7 Tesla are commonly used for both humans and animals, but for small-medium animal studies high field scanners operating at 7-9.4T are also quite common. Ultra-high field MR systems with fields of up to 17 T are also available mainly for preclinical studies.\nIn microMRI/MRS, the instruments are technically optimized for small animal studies, providing resolution in the mm to µm range.\nMRI, either as a single modality or paired to other imaging modalities, is largely used for *in vivo* (humans and animals) studies and also for ex-vivo analysis of specimens (organs or tissue samples).\nIn preclinical imaging, animal models of various pathologies, from tumors to cardiovascular, neurological or metabolic disorders, are commonly used to monitor disease development and to test the efficacy of therapeutic treatments, to develop novel diagnostic tools etc. Several quantitative imaging biomarkers can be used to monitor disease progression over time.\nAnimal imaging can also be used for veterinary studies.\nAt clinical level, MRI is generally a key tool for the diagnosis of various pathologies and for monitoring the efficacy of new therapies. It is also commonly used in studies involving healthy volunteers to evaluate metabolism or functions.\nMRI comprises a large number of techniques for various applications ranging from simple morphological measurements throughout all organs to the evaluation of complex systems, functions, and processes in living organisms.\n**Preclinical and ex-vivo MRI**is provided by the following Nodes:\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed - DIMP NEUROMED](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Facility of Multimodal Imaging - AMMI Maastricht (NL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/facility-of-excellence-in-imaging---alm-and-molecular-imaging-node-maastricht)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Medical and Preclinical Imaging Hungary (HU)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Population Imaging Node Valencia (ES)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/population-imaging-valencia)\n* [Preclinical Imaging Centre (PRIME) - Molecular Imaging Dutch Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node)\n* [NORMOLIM, Norwegian Molecular Imaging Infrastructure](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)\n**Human MRI** is provided by the following Nodes:\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Population Imaging Node Valencia (ES)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/population-imaging-valencia)\n### Use cases\nClick here for\n[Use Cases](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/preclinical-and-medical-imaging-technologies-use-cases-from-our-nodes/) from our Nodes.\n## Anatomical, volumetric, morphometric MRI\nContrast in MRI images is generated by the differences in the nuclear relaxation times of water protons (T1 and T2) across tissues. The image contrast can be controlled by changing the values of specific acquisition parameters, generally the echo time (TE) and the repetition time (TR). Depending on their values, it is possible to obtain images where the contrast and brightness are predominantly determined by the T1 or T2 properties of water in tissues (T1-weighted and T2-weighted images respectively).\nContrast agents are frequently administered to enhance the contrast for assessment of organ functions (perfusion, vascularity, permeability) or better delineation of specific lesions or tissues. Mainly Gd based molecules are used with the acquisition of T1-weighted images and for specific cases iron Oxides could be used with T2-weighted images.\nThe acquisition of anatomical MR images is done with the scope of obtaining detailed morphological information ( shape, size, volume, texture…) of various body regions or lesions (e.g. tumors, ischemia, cysts etc) and to monitor disease progression or regression.\n* Kinnunen K. M., et al. \"Volumetric MRI-Based Biomarkers in Huntington's Disease: An Evidentiary Review\", <https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.712555>\n* McCarthy J., et al. \"Morphometric MRI as a diagnostic biomarker of frontotemporal dementia: A systematic review to determine clinical applicability\", <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2018.08.028>\nWhile MR images are typically assessed in a qualitative way, MRI can collect quantitative information about tissue properties. The range of properties includes the magnetic resonance (MR) relaxation times T1 and T2, T2\\*, diffusion, perfusion, fat and water fractions, iron fraction, elastic properties of tissue, temperature, chemical composition, and chemical exchange, just to mention some. Of note, new MRI methods are constantly being developed. By using the sensitivity of MRI to these tissue properties, it is possible to generate quantitative maps instead of qualitative anatomical images, where the intensity of each pixel corresponds to a measurement of one specific physical or physiological property. Quantitative measurements could help not only for identifying anatomical abnormalities but also for detecting initial loss of function or tissue alteration.\n[Use cases](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/content/use-cases/#volumetric)\n**Available at:**\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed - DIMP NEUROMED](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Facility of Multimodal Imaging - AMMI Maastricht (NL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/facility-of-excellence-in-imaging---alm-and-molecular-imaging-node-maastricht)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Medical and Preclinical Imaging Hungary (HU)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Preclinical Imaging Centre (PRIME) - Molecular Imaging Dutch Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node)\n* [NORMOLIM, Norwegian Molecular Imaging Infrastructure](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Medical and Preclinicial Imaging Hungary](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n## Relaxation mapping - T1, T2, T2\\*, spin-lock MR techniques\nThe signal intensity in  MR images is  a function of water content, tissue properties and of MRI acquisition parameters.\nFor quantitative MR imaging, tissue relaxation times are measured by extracting the signal exponential decay (T2 or T2\\*) or recovery (T1) from multiple measurements.  T1, T2 and/or T1rho parametric images can be acquired.\nThe quantification of relaxation times provides more detailed information on the tissue characteristics (tumor cells invasion, ischemic lesions, vascular leakage, iron deposition, inflammation etc), thus supporting the clinicians in the diagnostic process. Furthermore, relaxation maps are used to quantitatively assess the presence of exogenous contrast agents.\nExample applications:\n* Evaluation of the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix in cartilage (T.J. Moshet et al., “Cartilage MRI T2 Relaxation Time Mapping: Overview and Applications” Seminars in Musculoskeletal Radiology, 2004, 8, 355) and of myocardial pathologies (<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcmg.2013.05.005>).\n* Detection of initial nerve degeneration in ALS (N.

Diffusion imaging is used to obtain important information about water movements within the architecture of tissues. This is achieved by using MRI sequences specifically designed to  measure the values of the water diffusion coefficient (Diffusion Weighted Imaging) and its components along the 3D space (Diffusion Tensor imaging).\nNeither contrast agents nor specific instrumentation are requested for this kind of experiments.\nDiffusion MRI is used to evaluate the molecular function and micro-architecture of tissues, and it acts as a tool for monitoring treatment response and disease progression for a variety of pathologies such as tumors, white matter diseases, inflammatory diseases and so on.

In the first case, dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC)-MRI, which measures the signal loss in T2- or T2\\*-weighted images, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI, which measures the signal loss in T1-weighted images, are used. In the latter case, arterial spin-labeling (ASL) is used.\nWhile ASL is mainly applied for the measurement of cerebral perfusion, DSC and DCE-MRI are used in a wider variety of clinical applications, including the classification of tumors, stroke regions, and characterization of other diseases, as well as for assessing response to antiangiogenic therapies.\n* Boxerman J.L., et al. \"Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast MR Imaging in Glioma: Review of Current Clinical Practice.\" <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2016.06.005>\n* Sujlana, et al. \"Review of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI: Technical aspects and applications in the musculoskeletal system\", <https://doi.org/10.1002/jmri.25810>\nIn neurology, brain perfusion parameters such as Normalized Cerebral Blood Flow (NCBF) and Cerebral Blood Volume (CBV) are relevant hemodynamic parameters, as their changes can precede abnormalities on conventional MR imaging. Thus, knowledge of whether a lesion identified in anatomic images is associated with increased or decreased CBF or CBV can frequently help narrow the differential diagnosis.\n![](upload/asl-mrileft.png)\n![](upload/asl-mriright.png)\nMR images (A) and parameter maps calculated from data of both dynamic susceptibility-contrast MRI (B), and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (C), obtained from a patient with anaplastic astrocytoma in the frontal lobe of the brain.

It is typically based on dynamic measurement of brain with BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent) contrast which is achievable with T2\\* weighted images (e.g. GRE EPI). Other contrast principles can be used as well (e.g. blood perfusion). Typical spatial resolution ranges from 3 x 3 x 3 mm to 2 x 2 x 2 mm in whole brain coverage, or even up to 0.1 mm in limited field of view and at ultra-high fields (7T or more). Temporal resolution ranges from 3 s to 0.5 s with EPI sequence.\nfMRI can be used in medical research (and diagnostics) as well as psychology, neuroeconomy, and other disciplines related to understanding human brain and behavior. It is typically used to measure neural activity during tasks or following to stimuli (e.g. scenario with auditory, visual or tactile stimuli distributed during the acquisition time to induce required brain activity), but resting-state fMRI is possible too. It allows to obtain activation maps, evaluate the hemodynamic response in selected regions, estimate the functional connection among brain regions, and evaluate the relationship between activity/connectivity and external variables.\nfMRI can be combined with electrophysiological recordings or stimulation.\nA special case is fMRI hyperscanning (dual fMRI) with two participants measured simultaneously in two scanners.\nExample applications include:\n* localization of brain functions and networks\n* monitoring brain changes caused by stress\n* discovering brain changes in various diseases (e.g. Alzheimer disease, Schizophrenia etc)\n* understanding empathy, emotions and consciousness\n* understanding the learning process\n* observing brain plasticity, development, aging affects\n**Available at:**\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Medical and Preclinicial Imaging Hungary](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n## Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST), Magnetization Transfer (MT) MRI\nIn CEST imaging, a radiofrequency pulse is applied at the resonant frequency(ies) of exchangeable protons in a given molecule or metabolite, in order to reach a saturation state. Chemical exchange of the protons with those of water molecules causes the transfer of magnetic saturation to water over time. The subsequent decrease in water signal is detected by standard MR imaging sequences and provides an indirect measure of the concentration of the species of interest.\nCEST MRI can detect a variety of endogenous small molecules (e.g. glucose, glycogen, lactate, creatine, glutamate), proteins and enzymes for molecular imaging. Development of exogenous CEST agents, including diamagnetic CEST (DIACEST), paramagnetic CEST (PARACEST) and liposome-based (LIPOCEST) agents, greatly enhanced the sensitivity and specificity of CEST imaging (Longo D.L. et al.; “A snapshot of the vast array of diamagnetic CEST MRI contrast agents” <https://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.4715>; Ferrauto G. et al.; “LipoCEST and cellCEST imaging agents: opportunities and challenges” <https://doi.org/10.1002/wnan.1385>).\nCEST imaging can provide information on tissue pH, temperature, oxygenation, metabolism, enzymatic reactions as well as for molecular imaging applications. Example applications include several disorders such as acute stroke, renal injury, tumors and multiple sclerosis.\n![](upload/chemicalmri.png)\nApplication of MRI-CEST tumor pH imaging for assessing response to novel anticancer therapies.

The MT contrast is different from T1, T2, and PD, and it likely reflects the structural integrity of the tissue being imaged. Applications include tissue characterization, such as evaluation of multiple sclerosis and other white-matter lesions and in tumors.\nSee also: van Zijl PCM et al.; “Magnetization Transfer Contrast and Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer MRI.

Since the molecular concentrations of these metabolites are at least 10.000 times lower than water, they produce correspondingly much lower signal strengths. Thus, to detect enough signal above noise for quantification, 1H-MRSI must use much larger voxel sizes in comparison to MRI, leading to lower spatial resolution with respect to anatomical imaging. The use of high magnetic fields allows to overcome this issue.\nMRSI is used in the clinics for quantifying metabolic abnormalities in the human brain, prostate, breast and other organs.\nSee for example:\n* T.A.A. Boroeders et al., “Glutamate levels across deep brain structures in patients with a psychotic disorder and its relation with cognitive functioning”, [http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2021...](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.01.21250977)\n* A.A.

Nevertheless, technological progress, development of acquisition methods and the availability of equipment operating at high magnetic fields have made in vivo heteronuclear MRI/MRS possible in both humans and small animals despite sensitivity limitation, widening the number of applications and the range of metabolites that can be mapped by MRS.\nSodium (23Na) MRI has been applied in a large variety of biomedical/clinical research areas. Sodium ions (Na+) play an important role in many cellular physiological processes. An unbalanced concentration gradient across the cell membranes or an increase in the intracellular Na+ content is an early marker of cell viability in many disease processes. 23Na-MRI can be used for studying heart diseases, by exploiting the increase in the extracellular sodium signal in acute ischemia, for cancer investigations, by measuring the increase of sodium content in proliferating cells, and for testing therapies by evaluating the intracellular sodium accumulation due to cell death <https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jacr.2007.07.001>).\n31P MRS can be used to study the energetic metabolism of a wide range of tissues such as muscle, heart, liver, and kidney in various pathological contexts. Using the endogenous 31P signal arising from the tissue, it is possible to obtain information about the energy status and also determine the intracellular pH (from the chemical shift of Pi). 31P signals from inorganic phosphate, adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, creatine phosphate and sugar phosphates can be observed in whole-cell preparations, intact tissues or organs. Phosphate metabolites that are involved in ATP production and utilization can be quantified non-invasively by 31P-MRS/MRI, while 31P magnetization transfer (MT) techniques allow in vivo measurement of metabolic fluxes via creatine kinase (CK) and ATP synthase (<https://doi.org/10.21037%2Fqims.2017.11.03>).\nFor 13C-MRI, hyperpolarized probes are usually used in order to increase the sensitivity of the technique (see Hyperpolarized MRI).\n19F MRI is increasingly emerging as a multi-nuclear (1H/19F) technique that can be exploited for several purposes, e.g. cell tracking, detection of active inflammation, measuring tissue oxygenation and to study fluorinated pharmaceuticals. The lack of a 19F background signal in tissues affords an unequivocal detection suitable for quantification. Fluorine-based contrast agents can be engineered as nanoemulsions, nanocapsules, or nanoparticles to label cells in vitro or in vivo. Multispectral 19F-MRI using different fluorinated compounds could be also used to detect different labeled cells simultaneously. Specific fluorinated products can be used to map pO2 heterogeneity in tissues.

This is particularly true for nuclei other than protons. Hyperpolarized probes are molecules where the nuclei polarization has been artificially raised. Conversely to standard MRI contrast agents, which act on the relaxation of water protons, hyperpolarized molecules are themselves the source of the NMR signal, thus yielding to signal intensity and SNR that linearly depend upon their concentration and polarization level. Long relaxation times of the hyperpolarized nuclei are essential in order to preserve the polarization for as long as possible. For this reason HP-MRI relies on the detection of heteronuclei rather than protons. For most applications 13C-probes are used.\nThe use of hyperpolarized probes allows to obtain very strong signal enhancements, thus overcoming the MR sensitivity issue and making the detection of low concentration biological molecules possible. Hyperpolarized probes are usually employed for perfusion studies and for mapping metabolites and their transformations through MRS in the body. Hyperpolarized metabolic imaging is particularly useful for the early diagnosis of cancer and monitoring of treatments efficacy because it can reveal changes that happen well before the onset of macroscopic signs of the disease. A typical example is the monitoring of pyruvate and lactate levels after injection of hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate.\nOther examples of applications in the preclinical and clinical fields can be found in the following reviews:\n* Z.J. Wang et al., Hyperpolarized 13C MRI: State of the Art and Future Directions, [https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol...](https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2019182391)\n* V.Z.

A difference in respect to MRI of other body regions is that cardiac and respiratory motions cause artifacts. Thus, CMR requires synchronous cardiac and respiratory gating or breath-holding techniques. Cardiac synchronization with ECG is often used to “freeze” the hearth during MR acquisition.\nMRI can also be used to record movies of the cardiac cycle that permit the extraction of a good number of dynamic cardiac parameters (cine MRI).\nFor more details on CMR techniques and applications see:\n* W.-Y.I.

MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields, radiofrequency pulses, and field gradients to generate images of soft tissues throughout the body.**\nContrast agents based on paramagnetic compounds are commonly used to enhance the signal/noise ratio and assess vascularization or tissue permeability. More recently,  novel classes of contrast agents have been developed, such as hyperpolarized molecules for high sensitivity metabolic studies, or CEST agents for accurate pH parametric imaging.\nMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) can be used to complement MRI in the characterization of tissues. While MRI makes use of water proton signals to create images, MRS uses either proton or heteronuclei signals to determine the relative concentrations of metabolites within a specific organ/tissue.\nMRI scanners at high magnetic fields have the advantage to significantly increase the sensitivity and thus improve the image resolution and scan duration. MRS also benefits from high magnetic fields with an increased spectral resolution, which improves the separation between different chemical components. Nowadays, scanners at 3-7 Tesla are commonly used for both humans and animals, but for small-medium animal studies high field scanners operating at 7-9.4T are also quite common. Ultra-high field MR systems with fields of up to 17 T are also available mainly for preclinical studies.\nIn microMRI/MRS, the instruments are technically optimized for small animal studies, providing resolution in the mm to µm range.\nMRI, either as a single modality or paired to other imaging modalities, is largely used for *in vivo* (humans and animals) studies and also for ex-vivo analysis of specimens (organs or tissue samples).\nIn preclinical imaging, animal models of various pathologies, from tumors to cardiovascular, neurological or metabolic disorders, are commonly used to monitor disease development and to test the efficacy of therapeutic treatments, to develop novel diagnostic tools etc. Several quantitative imaging biomarkers can be used to monitor disease progression over time.\nAnimal imaging can also be used for veterinary studies.\nAt clinical level, MRI is generally a key tool for the diagnosis of various pathologies and for monitoring the efficacy of new therapies. It is also commonly used in studies involving healthy volunteers to evaluate metabolism or functions.\nMRI comprises a large number of techniques for various applications ranging from simple morphological measurements throughout all organs to the evaluation of complex systems, functions, and processes in living organisms.\n**Preclinical and ex-vivo MRI**is provided by the following Nodes:\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed - DIMP NEUROMED](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Facility of Multimodal Imaging - AMMI Maastricht (NL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/facility-of-excellence-in-imaging---alm-and-molecular-imaging-node-maastricht)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Medical and Preclinical Imaging Hungary (HU)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Population Imaging Node Valencia (ES)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/population-imaging-valencia)\n* [Preclinical Imaging Centre (PRIME) - Molecular Imaging Dutch Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node)\n* [NORMOLIM, Norwegian Molecular Imaging Infrastructure](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)\n**Human MRI** is provided by the following Nodes:\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Population Imaging Node Valencia (ES)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/population-imaging-valencia)\n### Use cases\nClick here for\n[Use Cases](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/preclinical-and-medical-imaging-technologies-use-cases-from-our-nodes/) from our Nodes.\n## Anatomical, volumetric, morphometric MRI\nContrast in MRI images is generated by the differences in the nuclear relaxation times of water protons (T1 and T2) across tissues. The image contrast can be controlled by changing the values of specific acquisition parameters, generally the echo time (TE) and the repetition time (TR). Depending on their values, it is possible to obtain images where the contrast and brightness are predominantly determined by the T1 or T2 properties of water in tissues (T1-weighted and T2-weighted images respectively).\nContrast agents are frequently administered to enhance the contrast for assessment of organ functions (perfusion, vascularity, permeability) or better delineation of specific lesions or tissues. Mainly Gd based molecules are used with the acquisition of T1-weighted images and for specific cases iron Oxides could be used with T2-weighted images.\nThe acquisition of anatomical MR images is done with the scope of obtaining detailed morphological information ( shape, size, volume, texture…) of various body regions or lesions (e.g. tumors, ischemia, cysts etc) and to monitor disease progression or regression.\n* Kinnunen K. M., et al. \"Volumetric MRI-Based Biomarkers in Huntington's Disease: An Evidentiary Review\", <https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.712555>\n* McCarthy J., et al. \"Morphometric MRI as a diagnostic biomarker of frontotemporal dementia: A systematic review to determine clinical applicability\", <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2018.08.028>\nWhile MR images are typically assessed in a qualitative way, MRI can collect quantitative information about tissue properties. The range of properties includes the magnetic resonance (MR) relaxation times T1 and T2, T2\\*, diffusion, perfusion, fat and water fractions, iron fraction, elastic properties of tissue, temperature, chemical composition, and chemical exchange, just to mention some. Of note, new MRI methods are constantly being developed. By using the sensitivity of MRI to these tissue properties, it is possible to generate quantitative maps instead of qualitative anatomical images, where the intensity of each pixel corresponds to a measurement of one specific physical or physiological property. Quantitative measurements could help not only for identifying anatomical abnormalities but also for detecting initial loss of function or tissue alteration.\n[Use cases](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/content/use-cases/#volumetric)\n**Available at:**\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed - DIMP NEUROMED](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Facility of Multimodal Imaging - AMMI Maastricht (NL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/facility-of-excellence-in-imaging---alm-and-molecular-imaging-node-maastricht)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Medical and Preclinical Imaging Hungary (HU)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Preclinical Imaging Centre (PRIME) - Molecular Imaging Dutch Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node)\n* [NORMOLIM, Norwegian Molecular Imaging Infrastructure](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Medical and Preclinicial Imaging Hungary](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n## Relaxation mapping - T1, T2, T2\\*, spin-lock MR techniques\nThe signal intensity in  MR images is  a function of water content, tissue properties and of MRI acquisition parameters.\nFor quantitative MR imaging, tissue relaxation times are measured by extracting the signal exponential decay (T2 or T2\\*) or recovery (T1) from multiple measurements.  T1, T2 and/or T1rho parametric images can be acquired.\nThe quantification of relaxation times provides more detailed information on the tissue characteristics (tumor cells invasion, ischemic lesions, vascular leakage, iron deposition, inflammation etc), thus supporting the clinicians in the diagnostic process. Furthermore, relaxation maps are used to quantitatively assess the presence of exogenous contrast agents.\nExample applications:\n* Evaluation of the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix in cartilage (T.J.

Diffusion imaging is used to obtain important information about water movements within the architecture of tissues. This is achieved by using MRI sequences specifically designed to  measure the values of the water diffusion coefficient (Diffusion Weighted Imaging) and its components along the 3D space (Diffusion Tensor imaging).\nNeither contrast agents nor specific instrumentation are requested for this kind of experiments.\nDiffusion MRI is used to evaluate the molecular function and micro-architecture of tissues, and it acts as a tool for monitoring treatment response and disease progression for a variety of pathologies such as tumors, white matter diseases, inflammatory diseases and so on.

In the first case, dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC)-MRI, which measures the signal loss in T2- or T2\\*-weighted images, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI, which measures the signal loss in T1-weighted images, are used. In the latter case, arterial spin-labeling (ASL) is used.\nWhile ASL is mainly applied for the measurement of cerebral perfusion, DSC and DCE-MRI are used in a wider variety of clinical applications, including the classification of tumors, stroke regions, and characterization of other diseases, as well as for assessing response to antiangiogenic therapies.\n* Boxerman J.L., et al. \"Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast MR Imaging in Glioma: Review of Current Clinical Practice.\" <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2016.06.005>\n* Sujlana, et al. \"Review of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI: Technical aspects and applications in the musculoskeletal system\", <https://doi.org/10.1002/jmri.25810>\nIn neurology, brain perfusion parameters such as Normalized Cerebral Blood Flow (NCBF) and Cerebral Blood Volume (CBV) are relevant hemodynamic parameters, as their changes can precede abnormalities on conventional MR imaging. Thus, knowledge of whether a lesion identified in anatomic images is associated with increased or decreased CBF or CBV can frequently help narrow the differential diagnosis.\n![](upload/asl-mrileft.png)\n![](upload/asl-mriright.png)\nMR images (A) and parameter maps calculated from data of both dynamic susceptibility-contrast MRI (B), and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (C), obtained from a patient with anaplastic astrocytoma in the frontal lobe of the brain.

It is typically based on dynamic measurement of brain with BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent) contrast which is achievable with T2\\* weighted images (e.g. GRE EPI). Other contrast principles can be used as well (e.g. blood perfusion). Typical spatial resolution ranges from 3 x 3 x 3 mm to 2 x 2 x 2 mm in whole brain coverage, or even up to 0.1 mm in limited field of view and at ultra-high fields (7T or more). Temporal resolution ranges from 3 s to 0.5 s with EPI sequence.\nfMRI can be used in medical research (and diagnostics) as well as psychology, neuroeconomy, and other disciplines related to understanding human brain and behavior. It is typically used to measure neural activity during tasks or following to stimuli (e.g. scenario with auditory, visual or tactile stimuli distributed during the acquisition time to induce required brain activity), but resting-state fMRI is possible too. It allows to obtain activation maps, evaluate the hemodynamic response in selected regions, estimate the functional connection among brain regions, and evaluate the relationship between activity/connectivity and external variables.\nfMRI can be combined with electrophysiological recordings or stimulation.\nA special case is fMRI hyperscanning (dual fMRI) with two participants measured simultaneously in two scanners.\nExample applications include:\n* localization of brain functions and networks\n* monitoring brain changes caused by stress\n* discovering brain changes in various diseases (e.g. Alzheimer disease, Schizophrenia etc)\n* understanding empathy, emotions and consciousness\n* understanding the learning process\n* observing brain plasticity, development, aging affects\n**Available at:**\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Medical and Preclinicial Imaging Hungary](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n## Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST), Magnetization Transfer (MT) MRI\nIn CEST imaging, a radiofrequency pulse is applied at the resonant frequency(ies) of exchangeable protons in a given molecule or metabolite, in order to reach a saturation state. Chemical exchange of the protons with those of water molecules causes the transfer of magnetic saturation to water over time. The subsequent decrease in water signal is detected by standard MR imaging sequences and provides an indirect measure of the concentration of the species of interest.\nCEST MRI can detect a variety of endogenous small molecules (e.g. glucose, glycogen, lactate, creatine, glutamate), proteins and enzymes for molecular imaging. Development of exogenous CEST agents, including diamagnetic CEST (DIACEST), paramagnetic CEST (PARACEST) and liposome-based (LIPOCEST) agents, greatly enhanced the sensitivity and specificity of CEST imaging (Longo D.L. et al.; “A snapshot of the vast array of diamagnetic CEST MRI contrast agents” <https://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.4715>; Ferrauto G. et al.; “LipoCEST and cellCEST imaging agents: opportunities and challenges” <https://doi.org/10.1002/wnan.1385>).\nCEST imaging can provide information on tissue pH, temperature, oxygenation, metabolism, enzymatic reactions as well as for molecular imaging applications. Example applications include several disorders such as acute stroke, renal injury, tumors and multiple sclerosis.\n![](upload/chemicalmri.png)\nApplication of MRI-CEST tumor pH imaging for assessing response to novel anticancer therapies.

From [https://doi.org/10.3892/ijo.20...](https://doi.org/10.3892/ijo.2017.4029)\nMagnetization transfer (MT) is based on the observation of the immobile (restricted) hydrogen pool (protons bound to large macromolecular proteins and lipids, such as those found in such cellular membranes as myelin) throughout saturation of this restricted pool and detection on the mobile proton pool. The MT contrast is different from T1, T2, and PD, and it likely reflects the structural integrity of the tissue being imaged. Applications include tissue characterization, such as evaluation of multiple sclerosis and other white-matter lesions and in tumors.\nSee also: van Zijl PCM et al.; “Magnetization Transfer Contrast and Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer MRI.

Since the molecular concentrations of these metabolites are at least 10.000 times lower than water, they produce correspondingly much lower signal strengths. Thus, to detect enough signal above noise for quantification, 1H-MRSI must use much larger voxel sizes in comparison to MRI, leading to lower spatial resolution with respect to anatomical imaging. The use of high magnetic fields allows to overcome this issue.\nMRSI is used in the clinics for quantifying metabolic abnormalities in the human brain, prostate, breast and other organs.\nSee for example:\n* T.A.A. Boroeders et al., “Glutamate levels across deep brain structures in patients with a psychotic disorder and its relation with cognitive functioning”, [http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2021...](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.01.21250977)\n* A.A.

Nevertheless, technological progress, development of acquisition methods and the availability of equipment operating at high magnetic fields have made in vivo heteronuclear MRI/MRS possible in both humans and small animals despite sensitivity limitation, widening the number of applications and the range of metabolites that can be mapped by MRS.\nSodium (23Na) MRI has been applied in a large variety of biomedical/clinical research areas. Sodium ions (Na+) play an important role in many cellular physiological processes. An unbalanced concentration gradient across the cell membranes or an increase in the intracellular Na+ content is an early marker of cell viability in many disease processes. 23Na-MRI can be used for studying heart diseases, by exploiting the increase in the extracellular sodium signal in acute ischemia, for cancer investigations, by measuring the increase of sodium content in proliferating cells, and for testing therapies by evaluating the intracellular sodium accumulation due to cell death <https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jacr.2007.07.001>).\n31P MRS can be used to study the energetic metabolism of a wide range of tissues such as muscle, heart, liver, and kidney in various pathological contexts. Using the endogenous 31P signal arising from the tissue, it is possible to obtain information about the energy status and also determine the intracellular pH (from the chemical shift of Pi). 31P signals from inorganic phosphate, adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, creatine phosphate and sugar phosphates can be observed in whole-cell preparations, intact tissues or organs. Phosphate metabolites that are involved in ATP production and utilization can be quantified non-invasively by 31P-MRS/MRI, while 31P magnetization transfer (MT) techniques allow in vivo measurement of metabolic fluxes via creatine kinase (CK) and ATP synthase (<https://doi.org/10.21037%2Fqims.2017.11.03>).\nFor 13C-MRI, hyperpolarized probes are usually used in order to increase the sensitivity of the technique (see Hyperpolarized MRI).\n19F MRI is increasingly emerging as a multi-nuclear (1H/19F) technique that can be exploited for several purposes, e.g. cell tracking, detection of active inflammation, measuring tissue oxygenation and to study fluorinated pharmaceuticals. The lack of a 19F background signal in tissues affords an unequivocal detection suitable for quantification. Fluorine-based contrast agents can be engineered as nanoemulsions, nanocapsules, or nanoparticles to label cells in vitro or in vivo. Multispectral 19F-MRI using different fluorinated compounds could be also used to detect different labeled cells simultaneously. Specific fluorinated products can be used to map pO2 heterogeneity in tissues.

This is particularly true for nuclei other than protons. Hyperpolarized probes are molecules where the nuclei polarization has been artificially raised. Conversely to standard MRI contrast agents, which act on the relaxation of water protons, hyperpolarized molecules are themselves the source of the NMR signal, thus yielding to signal intensity and SNR that linearly depend upon their concentration and polarization level. Long relaxation times of the hyperpolarized nuclei are essential in order to preserve the polarization for as long as possible. For this reason HP-MRI relies on the detection of heteronuclei rather than protons. For most applications 13C-probes are used.\nThe use of hyperpolarized probes allows to obtain very strong signal enhancements, thus overcoming the MR sensitivity issue and making the detection of low concentration biological molecules possible. Hyperpolarized probes are usually employed for perfusion studies and for mapping metabolites and their transformations through MRS in the body. Hyperpolarized metabolic imaging is particularly useful for the early diagnosis of cancer and monitoring of treatments efficacy because it can reveal changes that happen well before the onset of macroscopic signs of the disease. A typical example is the monitoring of pyruvate and lactate levels after injection of hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate.\nOther examples of applications in the preclinical and clinical fields can be found in the following reviews:\n* Z.J. Wang et al., Hyperpolarized 13C MRI: State of the Art and Future Directions, [https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol...](https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2019182391)\n* V.Z.

A difference in respect to MRI of other body regions is that cardiac and respiratory motions cause artifacts. Thus, CMR requires synchronous cardiac and respiratory gating or breath-holding techniques. Cardiac synchronization with ECG is often used to “freeze” the hearth during MR acquisition.\nMRI can also be used to record movies of the cardiac cycle that permit the extraction of a good number of dynamic cardiac parameters (cine MRI).\nFor more details on CMR techniques and applications see:\n* W.-Y.I.

For instance, it can be applied to assess the decrease of ejection fraction (EF%) in the heart upon multiple administrations of Doxorubicin for cancer treatment.\n![](upload/CMR.png)\nMRI of heart in diastole or systole for ctrl untreated mice and mice treated with doxorubicin.

MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields, radiofrequency pulses, and field gradients to generate images of soft tissues throughout the body.**\nContrast agents based on paramagnetic compounds are commonly used to enhance the signal/noise ratio and assess vascularization or tissue permeability. More recently,  novel classes of contrast agents have been developed, such as hyperpolarized molecules for high sensitivity metabolic studies, or CEST agents for accurate pH parametric imaging.\nMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) can be used to complement MRI in the characterization of tissues. While MRI makes use of water proton signals to create images, MRS uses either proton or heteronuclei signals to determine the relative concentrations of metabolites within a specific organ/tissue.\nMRI scanners at high magnetic fields have the advantage to significantly increase the sensitivity and thus improve the image resolution and scan duration. MRS also benefits from high magnetic fields with an increased spectral resolution, which improves the separation between different chemical components. Nowadays, scanners at 3-7 Tesla are commonly used for both humans and animals, but for small-medium animal studies high field scanners operating at 7-9.4T are also quite common. Ultra-high field MR systems with fields of up to 17 T are also available mainly for preclinical studies.\nIn microMRI/MRS, the instruments are technically optimized for small animal studies, providing resolution in the mm to µm range.\nMRI, either as a single modality or paired to other imaging modalities, is largely used for *in vivo* (humans and animals) studies and also for ex-vivo analysis of specimens (organs or tissue samples).\nIn preclinical imaging, animal models of various pathologies, from tumors to cardiovascular, neurological or metabolic disorders, are commonly used to monitor disease development and to test the efficacy of therapeutic treatments, to develop novel diagnostic tools etc. Several quantitative imaging biomarkers can be used to monitor disease progression over time.\nAnimal imaging can also be used for veterinary studies.\nAt clinical level, MRI is generally a key tool for the diagnosis of various pathologies and for monitoring the efficacy of new therapies. It is also commonly used in studies involving healthy volunteers to evaluate metabolism or functions.\nMRI comprises a large number of techniques for various applications ranging from simple morphological measurements throughout all organs to the evaluation of complex systems, functions, and processes in living organisms.\n**Preclinical and ex-vivo MRI**is provided by the following Nodes:\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed - DIMP NEUROMED](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Facility of Multimodal Imaging - AMMI Maastricht (NL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/facility-of-excellence-in-imaging---alm-and-molecular-imaging-node-maastricht)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Medical and Preclinical Imaging Hungary (HU)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Population Imaging Node Valencia (ES)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/population-imaging-valencia)\n* [Preclinical Imaging Centre (PRIME) - Molecular Imaging Dutch Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node)\n* [NORMOLIM, Norwegian Molecular Imaging Infrastructure](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)\n**Human MRI** is provided by the following Nodes:\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Population Imaging Node Valencia (ES)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/population-imaging-valencia)\n### Use cases\nClick here for\n[Use Cases](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/preclinical-and-medical-imaging-technologies-use-cases-from-our-nodes/) from our Nodes.\n## Anatomical, volumetric, morphometric MRI\nContrast in MRI images is generated by the differences in the nuclear relaxation times of water protons (T1 and T2) across tissues. The image contrast can be controlled by changing the values of specific acquisition parameters, generally the echo time (TE) and the repetition time (TR). Depending on their values, it is possible to obtain images where the contrast and brightness are predominantly determined by the T1 or T2 properties of water in tissues (T1-weighted and T2-weighted images respectively).\nContrast agents are frequently administered to enhance the contrast for assessment of organ functions (perfusion, vascularity, permeability) or better delineation of specific lesions or tissues. Mainly Gd based molecules are used with the acquisition of T1-weighted images and for specific cases iron Oxides could be used with T2-weighted images.\nThe acquisition of anatomical MR images is done with the scope of obtaining detailed morphological information ( shape, size, volume, texture…) of various body regions or lesions (e.g. tumors, ischemia, cysts etc) and to monitor disease progression or regression.\n* Kinnunen K. M., et al. \"Volumetric MRI-Based Biomarkers in Huntington's Disease: An Evidentiary Review\", <https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.712555>\n* McCarthy J., et al. \"Morphometric MRI as a diagnostic biomarker of frontotemporal dementia: A systematic review to determine clinical applicability\", <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2018.08.028>\nWhile MR images are typically assessed in a qualitative way, MRI can collect quantitative information about tissue properties. The range of properties includes the magnetic resonance (MR) relaxation times T1 and T2, T2\\*, diffusion, perfusion, fat and water fractions, iron fraction, elastic properties of tissue, temperature, chemical composition, and chemical exchange, just to mention some. Of note, new MRI methods are constantly being developed. By using the sensitivity of MRI to these tissue properties, it is possible to generate quantitative maps instead of qualitative anatomical images, where the intensity of each pixel corresponds to a measurement of one specific physical or physiological property. Quantitative measurements could help not only for identifying anatomical abnormalities but also for detecting initial loss of function or tissue alteration.\n[Use cases](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/content/use-cases/#volumetric)\n**Available at:**\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed - DIMP NEUROMED](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/digital-imaging-multimodal-platform-neuromed---dimp-neuromed)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Facility of Multimodal Imaging - AMMI Maastricht (NL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/facility-of-excellence-in-imaging---alm-and-molecular-imaging-node-maastricht)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Medical and Preclinical Imaging Hungary (HU)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Preclinical Imaging Centre (PRIME) - Molecular Imaging Dutch Node](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/preclinical-imaging-centre-(prime)---molecular-imaging-dutch-node)\n* [NORMOLIM, Norwegian Molecular Imaging Infrastructure](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Medical and Preclinicial Imaging Hungary](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n## Relaxation mapping - T1, T2, T2\\*, spin-lock MR techniques\nThe signal intensity in  MR images is  a function of water content, tissue properties and of MRI acquisition parameters.\nFor quantitative MR imaging, tissue relaxation times are measured by extracting the signal exponential decay (T2 or T2\\*) or recovery (T1) from multiple measurements.  T1, T2 and/or T1rho parametric images can be acquired.\nThe quantification of relaxation times provides more detailed information on the tissue characteristics (tumor cells invasion, ischemic lesions, vascular leakage, iron deposition, inflammation etc), thus supporting the clinicians in the diagnostic process. Furthermore, relaxation maps are used to quantitatively assess the presence of exogenous contrast agents.\nExample applications:\n* Evaluation of the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix in cartilage (T.J. Moshet et al., “Cartilage MRI T2 Relaxation Time Mapping: Overview and Applications” Seminars in Musculoskeletal Radiology, 2004, 8, 355) and of myocardial pathologies (<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcmg.2013.05.005>).\n* Detection of initial nerve degeneration in ALS (N.

Diffusion imaging is used to obtain important information about water movements within the architecture of tissues. This is achieved by using MRI sequences specifically designed to  measure the values of the water diffusion coefficient (Diffusion Weighted Imaging) and its components along the 3D space (Diffusion Tensor imaging).\nNeither contrast agents nor specific instrumentation are requested for this kind of experiments.\nDiffusion MRI is used to evaluate the molecular function and micro-architecture of tissues, and it acts as a tool for monitoring treatment response and disease progression for a variety of pathologies such as tumors, white matter diseases, inflammatory diseases and so on.

In the first case, dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC)-MRI, which measures the signal loss in T2- or T2\\*-weighted images, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI, which measures the signal loss in T1-weighted images, are used. In the latter case, arterial spin-labeling (ASL) is used.\nWhile ASL is mainly applied for the measurement of cerebral perfusion, DSC and DCE-MRI are used in a wider variety of clinical applications, including the classification of tumors, stroke regions, and characterization of other diseases, as well as for assessing response to antiangiogenic therapies.\n* Boxerman J.L., et al. \"Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast MR Imaging in Glioma: Review of Current Clinical Practice.\" <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2016.06.005>\n* Sujlana, et al. \"Review of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI: Technical aspects and applications in the musculoskeletal system\", <https://doi.org/10.1002/jmri.25810>\nIn neurology, brain perfusion parameters such as Normalized Cerebral Blood Flow (NCBF) and Cerebral Blood Volume (CBV) are relevant hemodynamic parameters, as their changes can precede abnormalities on conventional MR imaging. Thus, knowledge of whether a lesion identified in anatomic images is associated with increased or decreased CBF or CBV can frequently help narrow the differential diagnosis.\n![](upload/asl-mrileft.png)\n![](upload/asl-mriright.png)\nMR images (A) and parameter maps calculated from data of both dynamic susceptibility-contrast MRI (B), and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (C), obtained from a patient with anaplastic astrocytoma in the frontal lobe of the brain.

It is typically based on dynamic measurement of brain with BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent) contrast which is achievable with T2\\* weighted images (e.g. GRE EPI). Other contrast principles can be used as well (e.g. blood perfusion). Typical spatial resolution ranges from 3 x 3 x 3 mm to 2 x 2 x 2 mm in whole brain coverage, or even up to 0.1 mm in limited field of view and at ultra-high fields (7T or more). Temporal resolution ranges from 3 s to 0.5 s with EPI sequence.\nfMRI can be used in medical research (and diagnostics) as well as psychology, neuroeconomy, and other disciplines related to understanding human brain and behavior. It is typically used to measure neural activity during tasks or following to stimuli (e.g. scenario with auditory, visual or tactile stimuli distributed during the acquisition time to induce required brain activity), but resting-state fMRI is possible too. It allows to obtain activation maps, evaluate the hemodynamic response in selected regions, estimate the functional connection among brain regions, and evaluate the relationship between activity/connectivity and external variables.\nfMRI can be combined with electrophysiological recordings or stimulation.\nA special case is fMRI hyperscanning (dual fMRI) with two participants measured simultaneously in two scanners.\nExample applications include:\n* localization of brain functions and networks\n* monitoring brain changes caused by stress\n* discovering brain changes in various diseases (e.g. Alzheimer disease, Schizophrenia etc)\n* understanding empathy, emotions and consciousness\n* understanding the learning process\n* observing brain plasticity, development, aging affects\n**Available at:**\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Austrian BioImaging / CMI (AT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/austrian-bioimagingcmi)\n* [Brain Imaging Network (BIN)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/brain-imaging-network-bin)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Medical and Preclinicial Imaging Hungary](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/medical-and-preclinical-imaging-hungary)\n## Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST), Magnetization Transfer (MT) MRI\nIn CEST imaging, a radiofrequency pulse is applied at the resonant frequency(ies) of exchangeable protons in a given molecule or metabolite, in order to reach a saturation state. Chemical exchange of the protons with those of water molecules causes the transfer of magnetic saturation to water over time. The subsequent decrease in water signal is detected by standard MR imaging sequences and provides an indirect measure of the concentration of the species of interest.\nCEST MRI can detect a variety of endogenous small molecules (e.g. glucose, glycogen, lactate, creatine, glutamate), proteins and enzymes for molecular imaging. Development of exogenous CEST agents, including diamagnetic CEST (DIACEST), paramagnetic CEST (PARACEST) and liposome-based (LIPOCEST) agents, greatly enhanced the sensitivity and specificity of CEST imaging (Longo D.L. et al.; “A snapshot of the vast array of diamagnetic CEST MRI contrast agents” <https://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.4715>; Ferrauto G. et al.; “LipoCEST and cellCEST imaging agents: opportunities and challenges” <https://doi.org/10.1002/wnan.1385>).\nCEST imaging can provide information on tissue pH, temperature, oxygenation, metabolism, enzymatic reactions as well as for molecular imaging applications. Example applications include several disorders such as acute stroke, renal injury, tumors and multiple sclerosis.\n![](upload/chemicalmri.png)\nApplication of MRI-CEST tumor pH imaging for assessing response to novel anticancer therapies.

The MT contrast is different from T1, T2, and PD, and it likely reflects the structural integrity of the tissue being imaged. Applications include tissue characterization, such as evaluation of multiple sclerosis and other white-matter lesions and in tumors.\nSee also: van Zijl PCM et al.; “Magnetization Transfer Contrast and Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer MRI.

Since the molecular concentrations of these metabolites are at least 10.000 times lower than water, they produce correspondingly much lower signal strengths. Thus, to detect enough signal above noise for quantification, 1H-MRSI must use much larger voxel sizes in comparison to MRI, leading to lower spatial resolution with respect to anatomical imaging. The use of high magnetic fields allows to overcome this issue.\nMRSI is used in the clinics for quantifying metabolic abnormalities in the human brain, prostate, breast and other organs.\nSee for example:\n* T.A.A.

Nevertheless, technological progress, development of acquisition methods and the availability of equipment operating at high magnetic fields have made in vivo heteronuclear MRI/MRS possible in both humans and small animals despite sensitivity limitation, widening the number of applications and the range of metabolites that can be mapped by MRS.\nSodium (23Na) MRI has been applied in a large variety of biomedical/clinical research areas. Sodium ions (Na+) play an important role in many cellular physiological processes. An unbalanced concentration gradient across the cell membranes or an increase in the intracellular Na+ content is an early marker of cell viability in many disease processes. 23Na-MRI can be used for studying heart diseases, by exploiting the increase in the extracellular sodium signal in acute ischemia, for cancer investigations, by measuring the increase of sodium content in proliferating cells, and for testing therapies by evaluating the intracellular sodium accumulation due to cell death <https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jacr.2007.07.001>).\n31P MRS can be used to study the energetic metabolism of a wide range of tissues such as muscle, heart, liver, and kidney in various pathological contexts. Using the endogenous 31P signal arising from the tissue, it is possible to obtain information about the energy status and also determine the intracellular pH (from the chemical shift of Pi). 31P signals from inorganic phosphate, adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, creatine phosphate and sugar phosphates can be observed in whole-cell preparations, intact tissues or organs. Phosphate metabolites that are involved in ATP production and utilization can be quantified non-invasively by 31P-MRS/MRI, while 31P magnetization transfer (MT) techniques allow in vivo measurement of metabolic fluxes via creatine kinase (CK) and ATP synthase (<https://doi.org/10.21037%2Fqims.2017.11.03>).\nFor 13C-MRI, hyperpolarized probes are usually used in order to increase the sensitivity of the technique (see Hyperpolarized MRI).\n19F MRI is increasingly emerging as a multi-nuclear (1H/19F) technique that can be exploited for several purposes, e.g. cell tracking, detection of active inflammation, measuring tissue oxygenation and to study fluorinated pharmaceuticals. The lack of a 19F background signal in tissues affords an unequivocal detection suitable for quantification. Fluorine-based contrast agents can be engineered as nanoemulsions, nanocapsules, or nanoparticles to label cells in vitro or in vivo. Multispectral 19F-MRI using different fluorinated compounds could be also used to detect different labeled cells simultaneously. Specific fluorinated products can be used to map pO2 heterogeneity in tissues.

This is particularly true for nuclei other than protons. Hyperpolarized probes are molecules where the nuclei polarization has been artificially raised. Conversely to standard MRI contrast agents, which act on the relaxation of water protons, hyperpolarized molecules are themselves the source of the NMR signal, thus yielding to signal intensity and SNR that linearly depend upon their concentration and polarization level. Long relaxation times of the hyperpolarized nuclei are essential in order to preserve the polarization for as long as possible. For this reason HP-MRI relies on the detection of heteronuclei rather than protons. For most applications 13C-probes are used.\nThe use of hyperpolarized probes allows to obtain very strong signal enhancements, thus overcoming the MR sensitivity issue and making the detection of low concentration biological molecules possible. Hyperpolarized probes are usually employed for perfusion studies and for mapping metabolites and their transformations through MRS in the body. Hyperpolarized metabolic imaging is particularly useful for the early diagnosis of cancer and monitoring of treatments efficacy because it can reveal changes that happen well before the onset of macroscopic signs of the disease. A typical example is the monitoring of pyruvate and lactate levels after injection of hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate.\nOther examples of applications in the preclinical and clinical fields can be found in the following reviews:\n* Z.J. Wang et al., Hyperpolarized 13C MRI: State of the Art and Future Directions, [https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol...](https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2019182391)\n* V.Z.

P. R., et al. \"Introduction to Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping and Susceptibility Weighted Imaging\", <https://doi.org/10.1259/bjr.20181016>\n**Available at:**\n* [Advanced Light Microscopy and Medical Imaging Node Brno CZ](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/advanced-light-microscopy-and-medical-imaging-node-brno-cz)\n* [Danish BioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)\n* [Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FI)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/finnish-biomedical-imaging-node)\n* [Flanders BioImaging Node (BE)](https://www.eurobioimaging-access.eu/nodes/flanders-bioimaging-imaging-node)\n* [Dutch High Field Imaging Hub](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/dutch-high-field-imaging-hub)\n* [Israel BioImaging (IL)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/israel-bioimaging)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n## Cardiovascular MRI (CMR)\nCardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) comprises a number of MRI techniques designed to assess various aspects of cardiac and vascular function, from cardiovascular morphology to ventricular function, myocardial perfusion, flow quantification and monitoring of coronary artery disease. A difference in respect to MRI of other body regions is that cardiac and respiratory motions cause artifacts. Thus, CMR requires synchronous cardiac and respiratory gating or breath-holding techniques. Cardiac synchronization with ECG is often used to “freeze” the hearth during MR acquisition.\nMRI can also be used to record movies of the cardiac cycle that permit the extraction of a good number of dynamic cardiac parameters (cine MRI).\nFor more details on CMR techniques and applications see:\n* W.-Y.I. Tseng et al., “Introduction to Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance: Technical Principles and Clinical Applications”, <https://doi.org/10.6515%2FACS20150616A>\n* Saeed M., Van T. A., Krug R., Hetts S.W., Wilson M.W. \"Cardiac MR imaging: current status and future direction.\" <https://doi.org/10.3978%2Fj.issn.2223-3652.2015.06.07>\nCardiac MRI can also be successfully used to establish the eventual side effects of drugs on heart anatomy and physiology. For instance, it can be applied to assess the decrease of ejection fraction (EF%) in the heart upon multiple administrations of Doxorubicin for cancer treatment.\n![](upload/CMR.png)\nMRI of heart in diastole or systole for ctrl untreated mice and mice treated with doxorubicin.

      "documentation": "micro-US\n## Ultrasound Imaging (US)\n---\nUltraSound Imaging (US) relies on the use of Ultrasound. Ultrasonic images are created by sending pulses of ultrasound into tissues and recording echoes, which are reflected to a different extent by different tissues.\nIn microUS, the instrumentation is implemented with accessories or with a technical set-up which provide optimum resolution and sensitivity for small animal studies.\nThe resolution range of US depends on which transducer is used. The higher transducer resolution, the higher the frequency, but the smaller the FOV. By choosing the right transducer it is thus possible to optimize US resolution and sensitivity for a specific organ or other tissue.\nUS imaging is particularly suitable to visualize soft tissues such as muscles, tendons, organs etc and for cardiovascular studies.\nSpecific US techniques and example applications of US imaging can be found  in the following articles:\n* C.M. Moran & A.J.W. Thomson, “Preclinical Ultrasound Imaging - A Review of Techniques and Imaging Applications”, <https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2020.00124>\n* A.

In 2D B-Mode US images the organs and tissues of\ninterest are depicted as dots of variable brightness, depending on the\namplitude of the returned echo signal.\n3D preclinical ultrasound images are generated by the acquisition of\nconsecutive B-mode ultrasound images acquired at discrete step sizes\nalong a predetermined path. Commercial software then reconstructs the\n3D volume.\nUsing High Frequency UltraSound (HFUS, frequency higher than 10MHz)\nallows to obtain very high resolution images (e.g. up to the\nmicroscopic scale in preclinical imaging).\nB-mode US imaging is widely used for visualizing and quantifying\nanatomical structures, such as for example organs, lesions, cysts or\ntumors as well as for the visualization of cardiac and vascular\nmovement across the cardiac cycle. Complete 3D acquisitions are\npossible over a cardiac cycle (4D) enabling the dynamic movement of\nthe heart to be viewed from any orientation.\n![](upload/Bmode.png)\n2D B-mode image of a rat heart in diastole, from [https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2...](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2020.00124)\nB-Mode US imaging is also used for needle placement during injection or aspiration\nprocedures.\n![](upload/needle.png)\nNeedle localization by HFUS.

A single line is selected in the B-mode image\nintersecting the chamber walls or valves of interest and ultrasound data is acquired only\nalong the pre-selected M-mode line. Consequently data is acquired with high temporal\nresolution, as only one line of data is acquired rather than 128 lines of data in a full\nB-mode image. The M-mode data is displayed as a continuous function of time scrolling across\nthe screen with depth on the y-axis and time on the x-axis.\nSee for example: Zhou YQ et al. “Comprehensive transthoracic cardiac imaging in mice using\nultrasound biomicroscopy with anatomical confirmation by magnetic resonance imaging”<https://doi.org/10.1152/physiolgenomics.00026.2004>.\n![](upload/mmode.png)\nM-Mode US imaging of the right ventricle with wall thickness measurements.\nCourtesy from Visualsonics\n**Available at:**\n* ****[Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)****\n* ****[NORMOLIM](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)****\n****## Color Doppler, Power Doppler (2D, 3D) US\nDoppler techniques are used to measure blood flow based on the Doppler principle: the\nfrequencies of transmitted and received US beams are different and the difference depends\non the velocity of the scattering red blood cells along the blood flow direction, on the\nUS beam frequency and on the angle between the US beam and the flow direction.\nUsing Color Doppler Mode, flow velocities within vessels are color-coded and the color\nintensity is a function of velocity. Blood moving away from the transducer (larger\nwavelength, i.e. red-shift) is usually encoded in shades of blue while blood moving toward\nthe transducer (shorter wavelength, i.e. blue-shift)  is encoded in shades of\nred.\nColor Doppler provides a visual overview of the flow within the vessels or in the heart,\nprovides an assessment of the flow direction and velocity and, when combined with 3D mode,\nallows to quantify the volume and percent of vascularity.\nIn Power Doppler mode the Doppler signal is displayed as a function of time within a\npre-selected region of interest. In this case, no directional information on blood flow is\nobtained but power Doppler is useful in the detection of small vessels containing slower\nblood flow and it allows to evaluate the percent vascularity.  Changes in vascularity\ncan be informative on the progression and regression of pathologies or on the response to\ntherapy.\n![](upload/colorus.png)\nPower Doppler image of mouse testes, from [https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2...](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2020.00124)\n**Available at:**\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI) (CZ)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n* [NORMOLIM](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/normolim,-norwegian-molecular-imaging-infrastructure)\n## Pulsed Wave Doppler US\nIn Pulsed Wave (PW) Doppler US, short and quick pulses of sound are sent and reflected\nsound waves between the pulses are analyzed. In respect to continuous Doppler techniques,\nPW Doppler US has the advantage of providing an accurate measure  of the blood\nvelocity in a precise location and in real time.\nPW Doppler can measure velocity of diastolic function, right ventricular function, renal\nartery resistive index and pulsatility index or abdominal aortic velocities.\n**Available at:**\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI) (CZ)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n## Non-Linear Contrast Mode US\nNonlinear Contrast Imaging is performed by intravenously injecting microbubbles, which on\nthe opposite of tissues which typically react linearly to ultrasound energy, react in a\nnon-linear way to the same energy (S. Unnikrishnan et al. “Microbubbles as Ultrasound\nContrast Agents for Molecular Imaging: Preparation and Application”, <https://doi.org/10.2214/AJR.12.8826>).\nThus, after removing or canceling the linear component of the backscattered signal, the\nincrease in non-linear signal as a function of time allows the evaluation of the kinetics\nand dynamic enhancement of organs. Non-targeted microbubbles allow to visualize and\nquantify blood perfusion within an organ or tissue of interest in 2D or 3D. Targeting\nmicrobubbles can also be used to visualize specific biomarkers e.g. in tumors.\n**Available at:**\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI) (CZ)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Molecular Imaging Italian Node (IT)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/molecular-imaging-italian-node)\n## US - Volumetric analysis\nVolumetric analysis is used to quantify the amount of the drug or contrast agent in the\nspecific organ volume. A 3D scan is used for this purpose.\n**Available at:**\n* [Center for Advanced Preclinical Imaging (CAPI) (CZ)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/center-for-advanced-preclinical-imaging-capi)\n* [Danish\nBioImaging (DK)](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/nodes/danish-bioimaging)****",

However, due to changes in sample morphology during the fixation and post-processing for EM, correlation of pre-embedding fluorescence images with post-embedding EM images can present a challenge.\nAn alternative method to pre-embedding CLEM is post-embedding CLEM, which has a different trade-off of challenges and advantages in performing the light microscopy at a different stage of the sample preparation process.\nThe Euro-BioImaging Nodes offering these techniques will support users in selecting the best method for their particular sample and scientific question",

The light microscopy and medical imaging units organize special programs for training scientists in biological and medical imaging techniques and data analysis.**\n### Specialties and expertise of the Node\nThe Euro-BioImaging Node in Brno consists of two parts. The **Medical Imaging** part is formed by two closely collaborating facilities. One is focused on animal ultra-high field MR imaging and spectroscopy (9.4T), the other on human MR imaging (3T) accompanied with electrophysiological techniques. Together, these facilities enable translational research and offer a complex portfolio of MRI techniques including multimodal approaches (e.g. simultaneous EEG-fMRI) and human hyper-scanning (fMRI with two participants measured simultaneously in two scanners). The **Advanced Light Microscopy** part is organized as a central core facility Cellular Imaging (CELLIM) and several closely cooperating laboratories offering together access to equipment, training and image analysis tools. The light microscopy is further specialized in imaging of plant systems, mammalian germs cells, stem cells and embryos, and development of image analysis tools.\nThe Experimental Biophotonics Facility of this Node offers user access to their Q-Phase Multimodal Holographic Microscope developed in-house and commercialized by Tescan / Telight. The microscope provides highly quantitative and rapid measurements of cell behavior, mainly growth and motility, with unprecedented accuracy where the distribution of dry mass inside cells is determined with standard deviation of 0.4 pg/µm2. The microscopy is an implementation of Quantitative Phase Imaging where the dynamic morphometry with live cells in tissue culture is a label free technique and the accuracy is achieved by using an incoherent light source, which also uniquely allows quantitative imaging of cells in 3D environments such as collagen matrix.

The Node is also active in organizing training and courses focused on theoretical and practical aspects of basic and advanced microscopy techniques. Light microscopy instrumentation includes microscopy systems that range from multi-functional point and spinning disc confocal microscopes, light-sheet and intravital systems, up to high-end multi-photon and super-resolution microscopy systems. In the area of electron microscopy, the Node provides expertise and cutting-edge equipment for a broad range of biological sample preparation and ultrastructural imaging techniques, including some cryo techniques, a complete set of volume EM methods (electron tomography, FIB-SEM, SBF-SEM, AT), EDS elemental analysis and CLEM. Broad expertise in experiment design and data acquisition is also complemented by extensive data analysis services.**\n### Specialties and expertise of the Node\nThe main strength is the wide and deep expertise covering most of light and electron microscopy biological applications, allowed by the complementary nature of collaborating core facilities and more than 25 FTE of expert staff operating more than 50 advanced microscopy systems. In super-resolution imaging all main approaches are covered, including STED, SIM and SMLM, by multiple commercial systems from different manufacturers. Information about molecular dynamics and interactions can be obtained by functional imaging, particularly from spatial-temporal correlation analysis (point, line and image F(C)CS), FRAP, photoactivation, FRET, FLIM or PLIM. Label-free imaging profits from non-linear processes induced by femtosecond NIR lasers and offers methods like SHG, THG, autofluorescence FLIM including metabolic imaging and CARS not only for lipid droplets visualization. Innovative low-toxicity label-free imaging is offered by quantitative phase imaging (QPI). Plants growing in their natural gravity conditions can be directly visualized on the vertical microscope stage of CZ LSM880 with Airyscan. Fast 3D acquisitions are covered by spinning disc and light-sheet systems. In the light intravital microscopy (IVM), the node offers a complete package of services: advanced 2-photon imaging systems, infrastructure for the care and management of small rodents and assistance with surgeries. In electron microscopy the Node offers complete workflow from sample preparation (room temperature or cryo- methods, immunolocalization) through various imaging modalities (TEM, SEM, SBF-SEM, FIB-SEM, array tomography, STEM-EDS elemental analysis) to data analysis (clustering and colocalization in immunolabeling, 3D visualizations). Targeted CLEM workflows allow 3D ultrastructural imaging of rare structures. Data analysis ranges from commercial software packages (Imaris, Huygens, Amira, NIS-Elements and many more) via custom modified routines for image processing and analysis (for example image reconstruction, registration and semi-automatic and AI assisted segmentations, volume reconstruction and 3D visualization, tracking, colocalization analysis, mathematical modeling and analysis of photokinetic experiments, and more) to new software and modules development in the field of stereology and spatial statistics, FLIM and FCS methods.\n### Offered Technologies:\n*[ISIDORe](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/content/isidore) is a Horizon Europe funded project that brings together 154 partners from 32 countries around the world, and is designed to effectively support research on infectious diseases and increase preparedness for pandemic.*\n| Technologies | Euro-BioImaging | ISIDORe |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Deconvolution widefield microscopy (DWM) | ✓ | ✓ |\n| Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM/CLSM) | ✓ | ✓ |\n| Spinning disk confocal microscopy (SDCM) | ✓ | ✓ |\n| Structured illumination microscopy (SIM)\\* | ✓ | ✓ |\n| Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF) | ✓ | ✓ |\n| Two-photon microscopy (2P) | ✓ | ✓ |\n| cryoFM \\* | ✓ | ✓ |\n| Image Scanning microscopy (ISM) | ✓ | ✓ |\n| Single Molecula localisation microscopy (SMLM) | ✓ | ✓ |\n| Stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED) | ✓ | ✓ |\n| Single Particle Tracking (SPT) | ✓ | -

      "documentation": "## SPAIN\n## Barcelona Mesoscopic Imaging Node (BMIN)\n---\n**BMIN is a multi-sited, single-technology Flagship EuroBioimaging Node, with two access sites located in the area of Barcelona, at IRB Barcelona (Institute for Research in Biomedicine) and ICFO (Institute of Photonics Science). It offers open access to a wide range of mesoscopic imaging modalities, mostly based on ***Lightsheet Fluorescence Microscopy (LSFM)*** customized and unique instrumentation, for multiscale optical imaging spanning from 50µm to over 5 cm samples size. BMIN applications include the observation of living organisms, at fast imaging pace, great depth and “all around” (e.g. multiview), or imaging whole organs and organisms in toto with cellular resolution.**\n### Specialties and expertise of the Node\nThe imaging modalities are centrally devoted to multimodal **lightsheet imaging** (e.g. SPIM, DSLM, ASLM, iSPIM, OPM, “scattered” sLS, and more), which can be also combined with other complementary technologies for correlative workflows. BMIN aims to provide life scientists in the public and private sectors with full imaging workflows, including project’s definition and supervision, sample preparation, image data acquisition, bioimage analysis and visualization, and temporary data storage.\nLSFM enables either fast, gentle and/or large volume imaging with samples ranging from mid-sized organoids/spheroids up to embryos or entire organisms. Both living samples and fixed tissues can be imaged under LSFM with great benefits compared to conventional point-scanning 3D imaging techniques (e.g. confocal). At BMIN, seven custom instruments are designed to enhance specific imaging features or performance tailored to either the samples’ size or its longevity. Our strength stands in our ability to pick, or develop/adapt, the optical configuration that best suits the biological question, and in cases to tackle multiscale imaging with the combined use of several instruments.\nHere below, we review the features and advantages of the Lightsheet variants implemented at the Node’s instruments.\n![](upload/Lightsheet_imaging_Live_in_Zebrafish.png)\n**Lightsheet imaging, Live in Zebrafish**. Top Left: larva, head and trunk imaged at 2 angles. Macrophages movements in tail fin (Top Right) and head (Center): color scale shows time projection tracks. Bottom: Zebrafish embryo at different time points across epiboly.\nLightsheet (LS) variants and features available for multimodal live imaging.\n“**SPIM**”: Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy. With a static LS illumination, SPIM enables deep, fast and gentle imaging. Commonly set with a horizontal detection arm and vertical ligthsheet illumination, it offers the simplest and most flexible readout for samples hanging from the top or disposed in a cuvette or chamber.\n**Multiview SPIM**: Most instruments enable sample rotation, hence enabling one to access the sample from the best angle, or to generate a more homogeneous and more isotropic 3D volume in large samples after multiview reconstruction.\n**Double-sided illumination:**\nFor large samples, two lightsheets are used, e.g. from “right” and from “left”, and can be combined to improve the image quality over large fields of view\n**Double-sided detection:** Imaging large samples from both sides simultaneously enables sharper images with large samples. With live samples it results in faster imaging (no rotation), with cleared samples it extends the size of the sample that can be imaged.\n**DSLM:** *Digitally Scanned Lightsheet Microscopy.* The lightsheet is produced by a rapidly scanned beam (in one direction only) to form a LS that yields improved image contrast, quality and resolution. Especially suited to work in the two-photon regime.\n**ASLM**: *Axially Swept Lightsheet Microscopy.* While in SPIM, adjusting the LS focus to the field of view brings a known resolution trade-off, ASLM enables one tosweep the LS waist laterally to achieve the best possible axial resolution across the entire (or larger) field of view.\n**iSPIM**: An inverted SPIM. The illumination and detection objective lenses reach the sample from the top (e.g. by dipping). This inverted geometry allows for easy sample mounting in dish-like or chamber-slide sample carriers.\n**Refocused imaging**: This is either a SPIM or DSLM add-on based on active optics that adjusts the image plane across large volume without moving any part. By moving both the lightsheet and the focus optically, rather than the sample mechanically, one achieves fast volumetric imaging of living samples, reaching up to several tens of volumes per second.\n**OPM,** *Oblique Plane Microscopy*: the lightsheet is formed through the same detection lens and the image is reconstituted through an optical assembly downstream of the primary objective lens. Mounted on an inverted microscope, OPM enables to combine the lightsheet benefits with the use of conventional sample carriers (e.g. multiwell plates), hence true high-throughput and long-term live imaging.\n**MacroSPIM with optical clearing:** For large samples in the order of 5-30mm, imaging with cellular resolution in entire organs at variable magnifications (i.e. continuous zoom) ranging from 0.3x to 24x. Illumination and detection from both sides ease the capture of high contrast images in very large volumes. 3D Tiling enables good resolution over large volumes.\n**Diverging LS**: A diverging lightsheet fills a very extended field of view and offers to image exceptionally large sample (5-7cm or beyond) in a single scan. Typically suited to late development (e.g. late chicken embryo) or full organisms.\n**sLS:  Scattered ligthsheet***.*\nA label free modality that captures the elastic scattering of the laser through the sample to reveal specific scatterers, e.g. nanoparticles, different tissues composition or fibers in tissues\n**Sample mounting expertise:** Depending on the instrument and application, we can employ several strategies to mount and image the sample:\n* Embedding in agarose: top-mounted for live imaging or cleared inside the agarose block.\n* In conventional sample carriers: slide, chamber-slide, petri-dish, multiwell-plates.\n* Resting in a custom cuvette\n* Fluidic approach: imaging samples flowing through a tube enables high-throughput imaging, turning a SPIM into a 3D image-based flow cytometer.\n**Optical Clearing expertise****:** a wide range of clearing protocols have been integrated and tested, including solvent-based for efficient clearing (“Murray’s clear” BABB, DISCO family e.g. iDISCO+, including whole-mount immunofluorescence, DeepCLEAR, PEGASOS, FocusClear, ECI, ECI2, etc..) and water-based clearing for the preservation of endogeneously expressed fluorescent proteins (CUBIC, CLARITY, etc..). We have tested a large variety of clearing protocols since 2010 and we are able to define a strategy to find in reasonable time which technique is best suited to the target sample/tissue.\n![](upload/Cleared_organs.png)\n**Cleared organs imaged with lightsheet microscopes:** Top Left: GFP-expressing metastases in Liver (1mm chunk), Top Right: Whole Bladder (7mm diameter) with tumour (blue tumour, grey Autofluorescence) and nanoparticles (scattered lightsheet, orange), Bottom Left: Whole mouse Brain (1.5cm) with Alzheimer plaques (thioflavin staining), Bottom Right: Chicken embryo stage HH39 (5cm beak-to-toe, Autofluorescence surface render).\n**Label free capabilities**: Through cleared tissues, autofluorescence and scattered lightsheet imaging can provide additional and complementary channels for tissue imaging. Using non-fluorescent elastic scattering of the lightsheet illumination, macroscopic structures or exogenous targets (e.g. nanoparticles) can be revealed at very low laser power levels.\n***Large data image analysis****:*The Node develops tools to enable large image data (>TBs) processing of lightsheet data, including tiled images stitching, multiview fusions, live data analysis, cell tracking.\n***Complementary imaging modalities:***\nWhether to check the sample at higher resolution or to perform correlative imaging workflows, the Node offers alternative modalities to be used in combination with lightsheet imaging, including confocal microscopy, non linear microscopy, super resolution microscopy, Raman microscopy histological sectioning and imaging, etc.\n### Offered Technologies\n* Lightsheet Mesoscopic Imaging (SPIM /sDSLM)\n* Tissue Clearing\\*\n* Expansion Microscopy\\*\n* High-Speed Imaging\\*\n* Feedback Microscopy\\*\n* Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM/CSLM)\n* High Throughput Microscopy / High-Content Screening (HTM/HCS)\n* Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIM)\n* Two-Photon microscopy (2P)\n* Second/Third Harmonic Generation\n* Raman Spectroscopy\n* Image analysis -bio (IA-bio)\\*\n### Additional Services offered by the Node\n* Project planning and methodological setup (e.g. design of study protocol and standard operation procedures)\n* Instruments\n* Training in sample preparation and mounting\n* Customization of sample mounting\n* Technical assistance to run instrument\n* Probe preparation\n* Animal facilities (Drosophila)\n* Wet lab space\n* Bioimage Data processing, analysis and visualization facilities\n* Bioimage Data storage\n* Meeting and training seminar rooms\n* Administrative support for housing\n* Training in infrastructure use\n* Training workstations\n* Biological material storage and processing\n* Training in techniques for optical clearing of biological samples\n* Workshop services for mechanical prototyping (metal, 3D printed), electronics\n* Histology services (separate service) for correlative imaging after lightsheet imaging\n### Instrument highlights\n* DSLM with Two-photon (2P) excitation,\n* Multiview SPIM imaging,\n* DSLM with dual sided illumination, ASLM for high resolution across large field of view, and all optical refocusing for fast volumetric imaging,\n* Macro DSLM: DSLM at low magnification for 0.5-1cm cleared tissues,\n* MacroSPIM: SPIM with ASLM at low magnification for 0.5-3cm cleared tissues, dual side illumination dual side collection,\n* LEMOLISH: SPIM at very low magnification for 1-5cm cleared tissues, single-side illumination, dual side collection,\n* SPIM with fluidics sample mounting for High-throughput Imaging\n* SPIM for in vivo imaging and/or with fluidic sample mounting dual side illumination, dual side collection,\n* SPIM for fast volumetric imaging, incorporating electrically tunable lenses or adaptive optics,\n* Scattered Lightsheet label-free imaging available for cleared and living samples,\n* Oblique Plane Microscopy (dOPM): lightsheet *on an inverted microscope* for High-Throughput Live Imaging, dual view.\n![](upload/Classical_SPIM_with_DSLM.png)\nTop, from Left to right: Classical SPIM with DSLM for high resolution imaging, SPIM for multimodal imaging (with double-sided illumination and multiple detection) with fluidics for sample mounting, iSPIM for fast refocused imaging at high resolution, dOPM for high-throughput imaging in multiwell plates (figure adapted from Maioli et al Sci.

The Node provides expertise in the multimodal MR/PET imaging, machine learning approaches and development of new radiolabeled molecules that can be used as tracers for processes that cannot currently be studied with PET, in clinical neuroscience, oncology and cardiology. Work is complemented by studies on developing new nuclides on the cyclotron to respond to new clinical and research needs and also services to the local pharmaceutical companies regarding pre-clinical testing of new, candidate drugs currently under development.**\n### Specialties and expertise of the Node\nThe BIN Node offers an innovative technology at European leading level, because it combines PET and MR studies of the same subject in the same day (often two PET in the same visit, because of the possibilities of using short lived Carbon 11 tracers and one or more MR scans). The feasibility of MR-PET projects is ensured by the availability of a local Radiopharmacy-CYCLOTRON Facility which helps to provide PET- radiotracers adequate for specific research questions. A number of radiotracers (focus on F18, C11, GA68, CU64 and N13), allow for flexible exploitation of multiple applications. A local clinical trial Unit is also present at the Node, to provide researchers support in their interaction with regulatory authorities. Machine learning approaches are also a strong asset.\n### Offered Technologies\n| Technologies | Euro-BioImaging |\n| --- | --- |\n| micro-MRI/MRS (Field >= 7 T) (HF) | ✓ |\n| micro-PET | ✓ |\n| micro-US | ✓ |\n| in vivo optical imaging (OI) | ✓ |\n| PhotoAcoustic Imaging (PAI) - med | ✓ |\n| micro-PET/MRI | ✓ |\n| MRI/MRS (< 7T) | ✓ |\n| MRI-PET | ✓ |\n| PET | ✓ |\n| Population Imaging (PI-med) | ✓ |\n| micro-MRI/MRS (>= 7T) - ex-vivo | ✓ |\n| Population Imaging (PI-data) | ✓ |\n### Additional services offered by the Node\n* Project planning and methodological setup, including clinical trials\n* Data processing and analysis\n* Data storage\n* Patient / Subject recruitment\n* Animal housing\n* Radiopharmacy\n### Instrument highlights\nOur PET – Cyclotron facilities allow for flexible use of different types of radiotracers, short and long lived, the former even allowing for multiple scans in the same day.\nOur MR facility has a research agreement with the Industrial provider which permits the implementation of high-end research protocols (WIPs, including multinuclear approaches).\nAn important feature is the ability to perform simultaneous EEG/fMRI and Transcraneal Magnetic Stimulation within the MR bore.\n### Contact details\n**Current URLs**\n<https://www.uc.pt/en/icnas> (Organic Unit)\n<https://www.uc.pt/en/uid/cibit> (Research Support)\n<https://www.uc.pt/en/brainimaging> (Focus on Neuroimaging Support)\n**Contacts**\nMiguel Castelo-Branco, [mcbranco@fmed.uc.pt](mailto:mcbranco@fmed.uc.pt) (Coordinator)\nSonia Pires, [soniapires@uc.pt](mailto:soniapires@uc.pt) (Administrative Office)\nSara Ribeiro, [sararibeiro@uc.pt](mailto:sararibeiro@uc.pt) (Administrative Office)\nJoao Castelhano, [joaocastelhano@uc.pt](mailto:joaocastelhano@uc.pt) (Imaging and Technical Support)\nCatarina Duarte, [CatarinaDuarte@uc.pt](mailto:CatarinaDuarte@uc.pt) (Imaging and Technical Support)\nPedro Almeida, [palmeida@securenetworks.pt](mailto:palmeida@securenetworks.pt) (IT Technical Support)\nAntero Abrunhosa, [antero@pet.uc.pt](mailto:antero@pet.uc.pt) (Head of University Organic Unit)",

In addition, the research opportunities in the FiBI Node also cover development and validation of new imaging and other health care technologies, new imaging tracers and probes, and new tools for advanced image processing and analysis.\nSpecial features of the FiBI Node’s spearhead technologies are described below.\n##### **SPECIALITIES IN PET IMAGING**\n* Exceptionally broad collection of different PET tracers to study e.g., blood perfusion, glucose and fatty acid metabolism, (neuro)inflammation, and neurotransmission both in animals and humans. Just to mention a few examples, [15O]H2O, [18F]FDG, [18F]FTHA, and [11C]Acetate are among the most frequently asked tracers for cardiovascular and metabolic imaging, [11C]Methionine, [18F]rhPSMA7.3, and [68Ga]DOTANOC for cancer imaging, and [11C]Raclopride, [11C]PBR, [11C]PIB and [11C]UCB-J for neuroimaging. Our PET tracer portfolio is constantly being streamlined with new tracers developed in-house, so don’t hesitate to ask for more information about available options.\n* Numerous validated PET applications for animal and human studies:\n+ Cardiovascular PET specialties include diagnostics, characterization, and monitoring coronary artery disease, heart failure, and inflammatory processes of the cardiovascular system.\n+ Metabolic PET approaches provide various opportunities for studying key pathological processes such as insulin resistance and pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction in obesity, metabolic diseases, and T2 diabetes, and the effects of physical activity/inactivity on tissue specific and whole body metabolism.\n+ PET applications in neuroscience range from neurophysiology of aging brain, pathophysiology of neurogenerative diseases, mapping neuroreceptor systems in health and disease, molecular and functional processes (e.g. neuroinflammation) of different psychiatric and neurological disorders, to neurobiology of human behavior and emotions.\n+ Oncological PET expertise offers opportunities to assess and validate new hybrid imaging methods and image acquisition protocols in cancer diagnostics, and to develop new theranostic approaches for various types of cancers, such as prostate and breast cancer, neuroendocrine and other somatostatin receptor positive tumors, and malignant lymphoma.\n##### **SPECIALITIES IN PRECLINICAL HIGH-FIELD MRI**\n* Body movement tolerant, in-house developed technology for fMRI of awake animals. The technique allows for example diverse genetic, electrical, and pharmacologic manipulations and at the same time overcomes the interfering effects of anesthetics. It is minimally stressful to animals and it can also be combined with various brain stimulation or electrophysiological recordings providing flexible study designs.\n* Hyperpolarized MRI, a non-radioactive method for investigation of dynamic metabolic processes. The Node houses DNP-hyperpolarizer for 13C-labeled probes, such as pyruvate. Hyperpolarization increases MR sensitivity of 13C nuclei over 10000-fold for 1-2 minutes which allows real-time imaging of pathway-specific metabolic processes, where the injected probe is observed separately from its metabolites. Therefore, hyperpolarized MRI has applications in many diseases with altered metabolism including cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and a variety of inflammatory conditions.\n##### **SPECIALITIES IN MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY (MEG)**\n* Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is optimally suited for detecting neuronal dynamics in the cerebral cortex, which has made it a powerful tool in basic neuroscience research. The FiBI Node offers MEG-optimized experimental designs coupled with a wide range of sensory, motor and cognitive stimulus systems. The offered protocols can be used to study for example sensorimotor and proprioceptive brain activity related to body movements, cortical networks in language processing, and neuronal signaling of cognitive functions in health and disease. MEG is routinely combined with other complementary measures of human neurophysiology such as fMRI, EEG, TMS, and eye-tracking as well as with diverse behavioral measures.\n* Unique opportunities for MEG related imaging and neurotechnological development. New types of MEG sensors, hybrid MEG-MR systems, and next-generation MEG stimulator systems and monitoring devices are actively being developed in house.\n##### **SPECIALITIES IN OPTICAL INTRAVITAL IMAGING**\n* Multiphoton, widefield and intrinsic signal optical intravital imaging set-ups for studying e.g. ear skin vasculature, paw skin, brain, lymph node/mammary gland, tumors, and externalized internal organs such as the intestine, liver and spleen, and protocols and adapters for both anesthetized and behaving animals (brain imaging). These techniques can be used to study for example vascular networks, blood flow and leakage, cell tracking, and morphological changes in longitudinal settings. Advanced neuronal set-ups for brain imaging allow for example dynamic imaging of calcium- or voltage-sensitive proteins, micro-anatomic imaging of dendritic spines and mitochondria, and blood oxygenation and blood flow rate imaging. Brain imaging can also be performed in freely moving animals by using in-house developed home-cage device, where the animal can be exposed to cues, perform tasks or interact with other animals and coupled with physiological recordings.\n### New offer of technology\n*[ISIDORe](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/content/isidore) is a Horizon Europe funded project that brings together 154 partners from 32 countries around the world, and is designed to effectively support research on infectious diseases and increase preparedness for pandemic.*\n| Technologies | Euro-BioImaging | ISIDORe |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| micro-MRI/MRS (>= 7T) | ✓ | ✓ |\n| micro-MRI/MRS (< 7T) | ✓ | ✓ |\n| micro-CT | ✓ | ✓ |\n| micro-PET | ✓ | ✓ |\n| micro-US | ✓ | - |\n| in vivo Optical Imaging | ✓ | ✓ |\n| micro-PET/MRI | ✓ | ✓ |\n| micro-PET/CT | ✓ | ✓ |\n| micro-SPECT/CT | ✓ | – |\n| Intravital microscopy (IVM) - Med | ✓ | – |\n| MRI/MRS (>= 7T) | ✓ | – |\n| MRI/MRS (< 7T) | ✓ | ✓ |\n| MRI-PET | ✓ | – |\n| MEG | ✓ | \\_ |\n| PET | ✓ | ✓ |\n| PET/CT \\* | ✓ | ✓ |\n| micro-MRI/MRS (>= 7T) - ex-vivo | ✓ | – |\n| micro-MRI/MRS (< 7T) - ex-vivo | ✓ | – |\n| micro-CT - ex-vivo | ✓ | – |\n### Additional services offered by the Node\n* User-oriented project support with study design and management\n* Synthesis and development of radiotracers and radiopharmaceuticals\n* Various animal models for human diseases (e.g. mouse, rat, rabbit, and pig models)\n* Advanced animal experiment facilities\n* Assistance in patient and subject recruitment\n* Assistance in acquiring ethical permissions\n* Blood and tissue sampling, metabolite analyses, and pharmacokinetic modelling\n* Electrophysiological and behavioral measurements such as electroencephalography (EEG), navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS), and eye tracking\n* Wide variety of behavioural measurements\n* Basic and advanced training for using the equipment\n* Assistance in image processing, data analyses, and interpretation\n* Data storage\n### Instrument highlights\n**PET imaging:** Three whole body PET/CT scanners (GE Discovery MI, GE D690, GE Discovery VCT), human brain/animal PET scanner (CPS HRRT), simultaneous 3T PET/MRI (GE Healthcare Signa), two small animal PET/CT scanners (Siemens Inveon, Raycan), portable animal PET and CT scanners (Molecubes) and small animal PET scanner (Siemens).

      "documentation": "## BELGIUM\n## Flanders Bioimaging Imaging Node\n---\n**Flanders BioImaging is a multi-sited, multi-modality Node that offers a full and complementary portfolio of biological and biomedical imaging techniques and expertise, at scales ranging from the molecular all the way up to human/clinical imaging (“molecule to man”). The node comprises 9 separate imaging facilities spread across 5 sites, all situated within a 70km radius. Whilst each facility is well equipped for imaging in either the biological or biomedical domain, our strategy is to specialise in the particular spearpoint techniques as detailed in the section below.**\nThe Flanders Bioimaging Node itself is funded by the FWO International Research Infrastructure program, in co-ordination with the Department of Economy, Science and Innovation (EWI), whilst the combined available imaging infrastructure from the constituent sites represents more than €50mi investment.\n### Specialties and expertise of the Node\nFlanders Bioimaging aims to help develop projects for a wide range of users from academia and industry to understand disease at the molecular, cellular, organ and organism levels, and to help develop and validate biomarker tools to help guide drug development and precision medicine. Whilst our sites have broad expertise, there is an especial focus on the oncology and neurodegenerative disease settings.\nOur strategy is to focus on providing access to the leading applications (‘spearpoints’) that have been developed at each site – each spearpoint is described below.\n**SPECIALTIES IN CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL IMAGING:**\n●      Translation of novel CNS tracers\nThe Molecular Imaging and Research Clinic at KU Leuven (MIRaCLe) is well established in the validation and application of novel PET biomarkers to clinical populations for improved diagnosis and precision medicine for central nervous system (CNS) disease and especially neurodegeneration. The MIRaCLe platform focuses on translating novel PET candidates to first in human studies, including full quantitation and methodology development, as well as employing established markers for receptor occupancy studies in response to novel drugs in clinical populations, via interface with the UZL Clinical Trial unit.\n●      GMP production of nanobody theranostics\nThe *In vivo* Cellular and Molecular Imaging (ICMI) core facility at the VUB specialises in the development of new Nanobody-based (Nb) optical and nuclear diagnostic imaging probes and therapeutics for oncology and immuno-oncology in particular. Importantly, ICMI provides a GMP production platform for such Nb diagnostics & therapeutics, that includes selection of production vectors for (GMP-grade) Nanobody productions; Nanobody fermentation and purification protocols with qualification of in-process controls (IPCs) and analytical tests for follow-up and release; GLPgrade Nanobody batch production for *in vivo* PET imaging proof of concept studies and to support toxicity and stability studies and finally production of GMP-grade Nanobody batch that can be used for clinical translation.\n**SPECIALTIES IN PRECLINICAL IMAGING:**\n●      Multi-modality image-guided radiotherapy\nCORE ARTH (Animal facilities Radiological Techniques & Histology) Infinity at the University of Gent houses the SmART+ system for small animal irradiation, a unique system in Europe that combines multiple imaging modalities to allow the determination of biological target volumes (BTVs) for radiotherapy planning using non-uniform dose delivery protocols for automated nonhomogeneous doses.\nIn addition the facility has established pipelines for the integration of PET and MRI biomarkers to inform such higher dose delivery with the goal of targeting the more malignant or more radiation-resistant tumour areas. This comprehensive imaging biomarker platform also allows the monitoring of combination radio/chemotherapy responses and thus the validation of predictive imaging biomarkers.\n●      PET and High-field MRI characterisation of CNS disease models and therapy response\nThe *in vivo* small animal imaging facilities of the University of Antwerp consist of the Molecular Imaging Centre Antwerp and the Bio-Imaging Lab (MICA-BIL), and provides a battery of early biomarkers to evaluate neurodegenerative diseases, cancer as well as treatment response in a range of preclinical disease models. MICA-BIL makes use of PET biomarkers for the visualisation of proteinopathies, neuro-inflammation and presynaptic receptor density and combines functional connectivity and activity, structural integrity and connectivity from MRI. Fully optimised scan protocols and processing pipelines are available, including multi-modality integration to both increase predictive power and better discriminate underlying disease mechanisms and enable the early evaluation of potential treatments.\n**SPECIALTIES IN BIOLOGICAL IMAGING:**\no   Enteric Nervous System Imaging:\nThe Cell & Tissue Imaging Cluster (CIC) at KU Leuven integrates live fluorescence (single, two- and recently 3-photon), lattice light sheet and second and third harmonic imaging to provide multiplex real-time structural and physiological information on the enteric nervous system (ENS). The CIC is able to offer advanced (neuro)physiological imaging experimental setups involving (for example) the perfusion of drugs or electrical stimulation on widefield (incl. with high frame rate cameras), confocal, 2|3-photon, Abberior STED and Lattice Light sheet microscopes. Full protocols for physiological measurements in a range of sample types (including organs, tissue slices and organoids) on multiphoton/STED/LLS microscopes are available and extendable to allow pharmacological/electrical interventions at defined and accurate (ms) timepoints, with full analysis pipelines for the extraction and interpretation of valid physiological information from non-linear, superresolution and high-rate/noisy imaging data.\n* Correlative Light/Electron Microscopy:\nThe Biological Imaging Core (BIC) at the Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnology (VIB) houses a Zeiss Elyra 7-Structured Illumination Microscope (SIM)² equipped with the LSM980 two-photon module to enable accurate correlation of super-resolution light microscopy with EM data. This allows defined region study at resolutions ranging from 60nm (SIM²) to <20nm (PALM/d STORM) to nanometre ultrastructure via SEM, with Focused Ion Beam SEM (FIB-SEM) available to allow applications under cryo conditions. This dynamic 3D/4D super-resolution microscopy platform closes the resolution gap between LM and EM, expanding *in situ* structural analysis, and enables the correlation of protein clusters/complexes with morphological domains in organelles and tissues. Imaging neurodegenerative processes at the level of organelles and identifying the initial stages of protein/peptide aggregation, transmission and organellar involvement is a key focus, with the aim to better understand neurodegenerative mechanism(s) and identify novel targets for early diagnosis and therapy.\n* Pharmacokinetic Imaging:\nThe Gent Light Microscopy Core (GLiM; [www.ugent.be/glim](http://www.ugent.be/glim)) has expertise in pharmacokinetic imaging, i.e. the study of the physicochemical properties of single molecules and nanoparticles in biological systems. This technique makes use of advanced imaging (Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching, FRAP; Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy, FCS; Single Particle Tracking, SPT) with major applications in the study of drug delivery and nanoparticle therapy (nanomedicines) in a range of biological systems. GLiM also has unique and complementary expertise in the intracellular delivery of compounds, including labels for microscopy or preclinical imaging of cells, via ‘photoporation’ (valorized at GU via the formation of the spin-off Trince). A major focus is the development of techniques to elucidate nanoparticle transport mechanisms in spheroids and patient-derived tissue fragments with the goal of informing the development of a range of nanomedicines, with special focus on improved therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of cancer. Different pharmacological and biomechanical manipulations to enhance nanoparticle transport can also be studied and developed using these model systems and readouts.\n* Dynamic Optical Microscopy:\nThe Advanced Optical Microscopy Centre (AOMC) at the University of Hasselt has unique expertise in studying molecular dynamics via Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and image correlation spectroscopy (ICS), two powerful fluorescence methods especially suited to study the dynamics of live biological processes, enabling 'fluorescence-based dynamic structural biology’ investigations from the single-molecule scale via e.g. super-resolution, TIRF and confocal microscopes all the way to the organoid, organs and model organism length scale via state-of-the-art light-sheet microscopy. A particular focus is the application of FRET/ICS procedures to enable dynamic optical imaging in large multicellular assemblies and thus create a framework for super-resolved multidimensional correlation imaging (ICS) methods, furthermore to map viscosity/viscoelastic properties of/ diffusive heterogeneity within biomolecular assemblies below the 200-nm optical diffraction limit. Multiplex FRET combining space-and-time-resolved data recording is available to characterise heterogenous biological environments.\n* Systems microscopy:\nThe Antwerp Centre for Advanced Microscopy (ACAM;[www.acam-uantwerpen.be](http://www.acam-uantwerpen.be/)) develops data-driven microscopy approaches, based on a diversity of imaging technologies (incl. electron microscopy, high-throughput screening, live cell and light sheet microscopy) to gain insight in and expose novel therapeutic targets for human age-related diseases. ACAM has established end-to-end pipelines to query among others, oxidative stress and mitochondrial defects in human patient cells, synaptic connectivity in primary or iPSC-derived neurons, and DNA damage in cancer cells. High-end super-resolution and expansion microscopy in combination with cyclic staining is optimized for molecular-level investigations, while deep learning-enhanced image recognition enables cell type and state recognition in more complex, physiologically relevant biological specimens such as mixed cell cultures. A systematic workflow based on tissue clearing and light sheet microscopy allows cellular phenotyping of intact tissue mimics such as cerebral organoids and whole organs such as mouse brain. Thus, together our imaging expertise allows quantitative investigation of pathological defects across scales.\n### Additional services offered by the Node\n* Full project support, experimental design, user training\n* Wide range of disease models\n* Large animal scanning (mini-pigs)\n* BSL2 animal facility\n* SPF facility for high-field MRI imaging\n* Autoradiography of ex-vivo tissue with a wide range of isotopes\n* Laser microdissection and photoablation\n* Support for patient and subject recruitment for clinical studies\n* Support for obtaining preclinical and clinical ethical permission\n* Full clinical and preclinical quantitation for PET studies\n* Image processing and data analysis for all spearpoint technologies\n* Data storage and support for metadata definitions/implementation\n### Instrument Highlights\n**Clinical PET imaging:**\nTwo PET/CT scanners (GE Discovery MI, Siemens TruePoint), a simultaneous 3T PET/MRI (GE Healthcare Signa), four SPECT/CT scanners (Symbia Intevo Bold, GE Discovery NM530s CZT, GE Discovery MI, Siemens Symbia).

The integration of these three sites in one NL-HTM center creates a world leading expertise center in high-throughput microscopy for imaging based screening. Each center offers specific strength and expertise. Each of these sites has developed a high-end infrastructure covering a broad range of screening and imaging technologies. Leiden Cell Observatory is in particular experienced in high-throughput high-end microscopy using automated live cell time-lapse confocal microscopy in combination with focused RNAi and compound screening strategies. The CSC is specialized in automated high-throughput imaging based screens using low resolution high-throughput endpoint imaging. The NKI Screening Center is highly experienced and at the forefront in whole genome RNAi screening using genome-wide shRNA as well as siRNA libraries and the NKI Advanced Microscopy Center integrates high-end microscopy approaches into medium throughput automated microscopy settings.**\n### Specialties and expertise of the Node\nThe Dutch HTM flagship Node is specialized in the development and application of cell based screening assays in 2D and 3D with image-based assays and readouts. Screening platforms compromise small molecule collections, functional genomic screening collections including CRISPR, shRNA and siRNA. Special interest and expertise lies in the use of advanced fluorescence based reporter cell lines to monitor live signaling dynamics. For automated image analysis, screen analysis and data integration we have developed relevant image analysis and bioinformatics pipelines using different open sources software for image quantification. Another area of expertise is the use of quantitative data for computational modelling to obtain a mechanistic understanding of observed phenotypes. We also have extensive experience in combining HCS with functional imaging assays, employing e.g. FRET sensors for readout of second messenger cascades, receptor activation and receptor internalization. New fast FLIM approaches have been implemented on our automated microscopes as well.\n### Offered Technologies:\n*[ISIDORe](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/content/isidore) is a Horizon Europe funded project that brings together 154 partners from 32 countries around the world, and is designed to effectively support research on infectious diseases and increase preparedness for pandemic.*\n| Technologies | Euro-BioImaging | ISIDORe |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| High throughput microscopy/high content screening (HTM/HCS) | ✓ | ✓ |\n### Additional services offered by the Node\n* Instruments\n* Technical assistance to run instrument\n* Assistance with experimental design (e.g. experimental set up, choice of technique)\n* Training in infrastructure use\n* Probe preparation\n* Animal preparation\n* Wet lab space\n* Server Space\n* Data processing and analysis\n* Training workstations\n* Training seminar room\n* Biobanking, biological material storage and processing\n* Cell culture facilities - Safety level 1 and 2\n### Instrument highlights\nSpecial features of instruments at the NL-HTM node: 1) we have both high-end confocal microscopes all equipped for automated screening and low-end HTM imagers; 2) all microscopes set-ups are equipped for live cell imaging; 3) automated robotics dedicated to perform siRNA and compound screenings are associated with the HTM imagers.

Differently from conventional radiology, where the image formation relies on the absorption properties of the sample, these approaches are sensitive to the phase shifts produced by the sample on the incoming X-rays. Phase contrast is particularly effective for imaging of soft biological tissues, where the conventional technique has strong limitations due to the poor intrinsic X-ray absorption.\nThe beamline provides two stations working with monochromatic or white/pink X-ray beam for planar and Computed micro-Tomography (microCT) imaging. A CT system based on a micro-focus X-ray source, named TomoLab, is available, if required in the proposal, as auxiliary facility.\nThe Node offers full packages including image acquisition, reconstruction and data reduction tools.**\n### Specialties and expertise of the Node\nBeing part of the Elettra facility, the SYRMEP beamline is open to external users since 2000.

It is a multi-sited national infrastructure hosted by the following seven leading institutions spread across the UK: Edinburgh Super-Resolution Imaging Consortium (ESRIC), the Francis Crick Institute, King’s College London, Liverpool University, Octopus at Harwell, Oxford Brookes University and York University. They all offer state-of-the-art imaging equipment, expertise, training and image data services. The technologies can be applied to a wide range of fundamental and translational research projects at molecular to cellular resolutions, in single cells to 3D, in vitro models and whole organisms.**\nThe Euro-BioImaging [UK Node Manager](mailto:georgina@rms.org.uk) acts as the single point of contact who can direct potential users to the relevant imaging technology and site to undertake their experiments. We welcome applications from all biological and biomedical research disciplines. Projects will be prioritised based on technical feasibility and scientific merits. Support will be provided for the entire experimental pipeline including (where appropriate) initial user consultation, experimental planning, full hands-on training, assistance with sample preparation, gathering highest quality imaging data and data analysis.\n### Specialities and Expertise of the Node\n**[ESRIC:](https://www.esric.org/)**  SIM, dSTORM, PALM, spt-PALM, SRRF, STED, FLIM-FRET,\nTIRF, Spinning Disk Confocal\nESRIC comprises open access advanced imaging facilities specialising in super-resolution techniques. As well as cutting-edge equipment, we bring together a broad spectrum of knowledge and expertise in extending the boundaries of biological imaging beyond the diffraction limit. Current technologies include dSTORM/PALM/DNA-PAINT on Nikon N-STORM and Olympus Cell Excellence systems, gSTED, Tau STED and FLIM-FRET on a Leica SP8 with FALCON FLIM, Structured Illumination Microscopy on a Nikon N-SIM /SoRa hybrid system, and SRRF on an Andor Dragonfly spinning disk. Our equipment enables us to image objects in 3D at super-resolution in up to 4 colours, with resolutions ranging from 120nm down to 10nm.\n**[Francis Crick Institute:](https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/platforms-and-facilities/light-microscopy)** Lightsheet microscopy (from live organoids and embryos to\nfixed whole mouse organs), High Resolution                                                     Episcopic\nMicroscopy (HREM), Optical Projection Tomography (OPT)\nWe offer two methods for imaging thick samples, Lightsheet microscopy and High Resolution Episcopic Microscopy (HREM), with support for the entire experimental workflow, including sample prep, clearing, image analysis, and data management.\nOur Lightsheet systems cover two distinct application spaces: Larger fixed samples (10 - 20 mm) can be imaged with the LaVision Ultramicroscope whereas smaller living or fixed samples (50 - 500 µm) can be imaged with either the Luxendo MuVi or Viventis LS1. The Ultramicroscope can be used in combination with antibody labelling and tissue clearing to image many sample types, including whole mouse organs, later-stage embryos, tumors, and tissue sections. In contrast the MuVi and LS1 are suitable for live imaging of small samples such as spheroids, organoids, and early-stage embryos. The LS1 offers higher throughput whereas the MuVi can image thicker samples, and has been adapted with a pulsed IR laser for photo-stimulation.\nHREM is a simple block-face approach for imaging tissue and organ morphology that does not require endogenous tissue fluorescence or any form of antibody labelling. It was originally developed to characterise embryonic lethal mouse mutations and has been used to study cardiovascular, skeletal, and neurological defects in a wide variety of mouse models (eg: Vanyai et al, Development 2020.)\n[*King’s College London:*](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/facilities/euro-bioimaging-uk-node) STORM ,SIM, Lightsheet, FLIM, CLEM,Volume EM,\nLA-ICP-MS, Raman\nAt the atomic and nano scales, we support volume EM and CLEM workflows, cryo SEM and cryo TEM and are experts in freeze fracture. We provide cryo-focused ion beam SEM and are developing a complete pipeline from live cell to cryo ET leading to sub-tomographic averaging of proteins in situ.\nMoving down the resolution scale, we provide access and support in, super-resolution and low-toxicity live cell imaging (N-STORM 5.0 and SoRa, plus single and multi-photon lightsheet capability), as well as high-content and throughput spinning disc (Opera Phenix).\nExtending beyond optical imaging, we deliver analytical multi-modal imaging in the form of 2D or 3D spatial quantitative elemental and molecular imaging of both endogenous elements and metal tagged antibodies in cells and tissues using a multiplexing methodology whilst identifying associated lipids and biomolecules in a label free approach. Routine LA-ICP-MS (Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) has been integrated with DESI (Desorption electrospray ionisation)-MS and Raman Spectroscopy as a single unique correlative workflow. Together with integration of IR, this workflow will enable high resolution spatial mapping of lipid, nucleic acids and protein phosphorylation.\n[*Liverpool:*](https://cci.liv.ac.uk/index.html) Automated Live Cell Imaging, STORM, PALM, Bio AFM-TIRF, SIM2, Lightsheet, Cytometry, volume EM, TEM, MicroCT,                                Photoacoustic\nWe provide an integrated ensemble of imaging modalities in one place for imaging across scales from single molecule to cells and model organisms. Example projects include cell biology, surface science, biochemistry, and microbiology. Of particular note is our unique Bio AFM-TIRF imaging system for atomic force microscopy combined with dual fluorescence total internal reflection.

Facility users have access to a dedicated support team including microscopists, cell and molecular biologists, chemists, and data analysis experts. Users are provided with assistance at all stages of the experiment, including sample preparation and labelling, collection of data, and data analysis and interpretation. Custom data analysis packages are available and can be tailored to the requirements of a particular experiment. Accommodation and catering facilities are available on campus.\n[Oxford Brookes:](https://www.brookes.ac.uk/research/units/hls/centres/centre-for-bioimaging) SBF-SEM, SEM (tomography), CLEM, Cellular Electron\nTomography, High Pressure Freezing\nWe focus on providing volumeEM and CLEM workflows, including dual axis serial section cellular electron tomography and serial block face-scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM). We can work with fixed or high pressure frozen samples and have extensive expertise in eukaryotic parasite work and insect vectors. The centre is equipped with CATII culturing facilities within the Centre, as well as a SAPO licence to support these projects.\n[*York:*](https://www.york.ac.uk/biology/technology-facility/imaging-cytometry/) SIM, Multiphoton, Spatial Transcriptomics (GeoMX), Phase\nImaging /Holography, Confocal, Slide Scanner, cryoTEM,\ncryoSEM\nCurrent technologies include PALM/STORM/SIM2 via the Zeiss ELYRA 7, Spatial-omics via Nanostring GeoMX-DSP and 10X Visium, Label-free imaging via PhaseFocus LiveCyte and Tomocube and multiphoton imaging via Zeiss LSM980 AiryScan2 along with the more routine confocal, slide scanning and scanning and electron microscopy. The team have a wide breadth of biological expertise spanning plant sciences through to biomedicine, and are familiar with most sample types and sample preparation methods.\n### Additional services offered by the Node\n* Project planning and management\n* Wet lab\n* Cell culture facilities\n* Methodological setup\n* Facility induction\n* Technical assistance to prepare experiments and run instruments\n* Workstations\n* Data storage\n* Image acquisition\n* Image processing and analysis\n**Probes**\nAll sites within the EuBI UK Node operate within leading edge academic institutions and as such, many different types of probes, including plasmids, antibodies and chemical reagents are available within individual researcher labs. Additionally, a number of facilities maintain their own in-house reagents, including pre-labelled antibodies for super-resolution (STORM) and spatial transcriptomics.\n**Other model organisms**\nAll sites within the EuBI UK Node operate within leading edge academic institutions that host labs working with a broad range of different model organisms, including zebrafish, Drosophila and c.elegans. Facilities to support users working with such organisms would therefore be possible, subject to discussions and agreements with the appropriate academics.\n**High biological safety level**\nBSL2 facilities are available within a number of the laboratories at the host institutions for the EuBI UK Node facilities and can be made available to users following consultation with the site leads. Of note, Oxford Brookes holds a SAPO license for culturing Trypanosoma brucei within the imaging facility itself.\n### Instrument Highlights\n[***ESRIC:***](https://www.esric.org/)dSTORM/PALM/DNA-PAINT on Nikon N-STORM and Olympus Cell Excellence systems, gSTED, Tau STED and FLIM-FRET on a Leica SP8 with FALCON FLIM, SIM on a Nikon N-SIM /SoRa hybrid system, and SRRF on an Andor Dragonfly spinning disk.
