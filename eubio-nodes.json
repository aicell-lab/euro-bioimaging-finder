The light microscopy and medical imaging units organize special programs for training scientists in biological and medical imaging techniques and data analysis.</strong></p>\n<h3>Specialties and expertise of the Node</h3>\n<p>The Euro-BioImaging Node in Brno consists of two parts. The <strong>Medical Imaging</strong> part is formed by two closely collaborating facilities. One is focused on animal ultra-high field MR imaging and spectroscopy (9.4T), the other on human MR imaging (3T) accompanied with electrophysiological techniques. Together, these facilities enable translational research and offer a complex portfolio of MRI techniques including multimodal approaches (e.g. simultaneous EEG-fMRI) and human hyper-scanning (fMRI with two participants measured simultaneously in two scanners). The <strong>Advanced Light Microscopy</strong> part is organized as a central core facility Cellular Imaging (CELLIM) and several closely cooperating laboratories offering together access to equipment, training and image analysis tools. The light microscopy is further specialized in imaging of plant systems, mammalian germs cells, stem cells and embryos, and development of image analysis tools. </p>\n<p>The Experimental Biophotonics Facility of this Node offers user access to their Q-Phase Multimodal Holographic Microscope developed in-house and commercialized by Tescan / Telight. The microscope provides highly quantitative and rapid measurements of cell behavior, mainly growth and motility, with unprecedented accuracy where the distribution of dry mass inside cells is determined with standard deviation of 0.4 pg/µm2. The microscopy is an implementation of Quantitative Phase Imaging where the dynamic morphometry with live cells in tissue culture is a label free technique and the accuracy is achieved by using an incoherent light source, which also uniquely allows quantitative imaging of cells in 3D environments such as collagen matrix. Integrated fluorescence imaging is available for automated time-lapse with alternating phase imaging and overlaid images are available for examination.</p>\n<h3></h3><p><span></span></p><h3></h3><figure><img src=\"/upload/CELLIM_2.png\" data-image=\"27\" data-delete-url=\"ajax/action.data.upload?file=CELLIM_2.png\" data-delete-type=\"DELETE\" data-name=\"CELLIM_2.png\" data-orig=\"CELLIM_2.png\" style=\"width: 466px; height: 689px; display: block; margin: auto;\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" width=\"466\" height=\"689\"></figure>\n<h3>Offered Technologies:</h3>\n<table class=\"centered\">\n        <thead class=\"table-head\">\n          <tr>\n            <td>Technologies</td>\n            <td>Euro-BioImaging</td>\n          </tr>\n        </thead>\n        <tbody>\n            <tr>\n                <td>Deconvolution widefield microscopy (DWM)</td>\n                <td>✓</td>\n                </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM/CLSM)</td>\n                <td>✓</td>\n                </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>Spinning disk confocal microscopy (SDCM)</td>\n                <td>✓</td>\n                </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>Structured illumination microscopy (SIM)*</td>\n                <td>✓</td>\n                </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF)</td>\n                <td>✓</td>\n                </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>Image Scanning microscopy (ISM)</td>\n                <td>✓</td>\n                </tr>\n             <tr>\n                <td>Single Molecula localisation microscopy (SMLM)</td>\n                <td>✓</td>\n                </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>Light-sheet mesoscopic imaging (SPIM or dSLSM)</td>\n                <td>✓</td>\n                </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>Quantitative Phase Imaging* (QPI)</td>\n                <td>✓</td>\n                </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)</td>\n                <td>✓</td>\n                </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP)</td>\n                <td>✓</td>\n                </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>Expansion Microscopy *</td>\n                <td>✓</td>\n                </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>Tissue Clearing *</td>\n                <td>✓</td>\n                </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>micro-MRI/MRS (&gt;= 7T)</td>\n                <td>✓</td>\n                </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>micro-MRI/MRS (>=7T) - ex-vivo</td>\n                <td>✓</td>\n                </tr>\n              \n              <tr>\n                <td>Human MRI/MRS (&lt; 7T)</td>\n                <td>✓</td>\n                </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>Image Analysis-bio *</td>\n                <td>✓</td>\n                </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>Image Analysis-med *</td>\n                <td>✓</td>\n                </tr>\n              \n        </tbody>\n      </table>\n<h3></h3><figure><img src=\"/upload/CELLIM_4.jpg\" data-image=\"34\" data-delete-url=\"ajax/action.data.upload?file=CELLIM_4.jpg\" data-delete-type=\"DELETE\" data-name=\"CELLIM_4.jpg\" data-orig=\"CELLIM_4.jpg\" style=\"width: 716px; height: 482px; display: block; margin: auto;\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" width=\"716\" height=\"482\"></figure><h3></h3><h3>Instrument highlights</h3>\n<p>The Brno Node is equipped with two 3T Siemens Prisma scanners for human medical imaging.

The Node is also active in organizing training and courses focused on theoretical and practical aspects of basic and advanced microscopy techniques. Light microscopy instrumentation includes microscopy systems that range from multi-functional point and spinning disc confocal microscopes, light-sheet and intravital systems, up to high-end multi-photon and super-resolution microscopy systems. In the area of electron microscopy, the Node provides expertise and cutting-edge equipment for a broad range of biological sample preparation and ultrastructural imaging techniques, including some cryo techniques, a complete set of volume EM methods (electron tomography, FIB-SEM, SBF-SEM, AT), EDS elemental analysis and CLEM. Broad expertise in experiment design and data acquisition is also complemented by extensive data analysis services.</strong>\n</p><p><strong></strong></p>\n<h3>Specialties and expertise of the Node</h3>\n<p>The main strength is the wide and deep expertise covering most of light and electron microscopy biological applications, allowed by the complementary nature of collaborating core facilities and more than 25 FTE of expert staff operating more than 50 advanced microscopy systems. In super-resolution imaging all main approaches are covered, including STED, SIM and SMLM, by multiple commercial systems from different manufacturers. Information about molecular dynamics and interactions can be obtained by functional imaging, particularly from spatial-temporal correlation analysis (point, line and image F(C)CS), FRAP, photoactivation, FRET, FLIM or PLIM. Label-free imaging profits from non-linear processes induced by femtosecond NIR lasers and offers methods like SHG, THG, autofluorescence FLIM including metabolic imaging and CARS not only for lipid droplets visualization. Innovative low-toxicity label-free imaging is offered by quantitative phase imaging (QPI). Plants growing in their natural gravity conditions can be directly visualized on the vertical microscope stage of CZ LSM880 with Airyscan. Fast 3D acquisitions are covered by spinning disc and light-sheet systems. In the light intravital microscopy (IVM), the node offers a complete package of services: advanced 2-photon imaging systems, infrastructure for the care and management of small rodents and assistance with surgeries. In electron microscopy the Node offers complete workflow from sample preparation (room temperature or cryo- methods, immunolocalization) through various imaging modalities (TEM, SEM, SBF-SEM, FIB-SEM, array tomography, STEM-EDS elemental analysis) to data analysis (clustering and colocalization in immunolabeling, 3D visualizations). Targeted CLEM workflows allow 3D ultrastructural imaging of rare structures. Data analysis ranges from commercial software packages (Imaris, Huygens, Amira, NIS-Elements and many more) via custom modified routines for image processing and analysis (for example image reconstruction, registration and semi-automatic and AI assisted segmentations, volume reconstruction and 3D visualization, tracking, colocalization analysis, mathematical modeling and analysis of photokinetic experiments, and more) to new software and modules development in the field of stereology and spatial statistics, FLIM and FCS methods.\n</p>\n<h3>Offered Technologies:</h3>\n<p><em><a

It offers open access to a wide range of mesoscopic imaging modalities, mostly based on <em><strong>Lightsheet Fluorescence Microscopy (LSFM)</strong></em> customized and unique instrumentation, for multiscale optical imaging spanning from 50µm to over 5 cm samples size. BMIN applications include the observation of living organisms, at fast imaging pace, great depth and “all around” (e.g. multiview), or imaging whole organs and organisms in toto with cellular resolution. </strong></p><h3>Specialties and expertise of the Node</h3><p>The imaging modalities are centrally devoted to multimodal <strong>lightsheet imaging </strong>(e.g. SPIM, DSLM, ASLM, iSPIM, OPM, “scattered” sLS, and more), which can be also combined with other complementary technologies for correlative workflows. BMIN aims to provide life scientists in the public and private sectors with full imaging workflows, including project’s definition and supervision, sample preparation, image data acquisition, bioimage analysis and visualization, and temporary data storage.</p><p>LSFM enables either fast, gentle and/or large volume imaging with samples ranging from mid-sized organoids/spheroids up to embryos or entire organisms. Both living samples and fixed tissues can be imaged under LSFM with great benefits compared to conventional point-scanning 3D imaging techniques (e.g. confocal). At BMIN, seven custom instruments are designed to enhance specific imaging features or performance tailored to either the samples’ size or its longevity. Our strength stands in our ability to pick, or develop/adapt, the optical configuration that best suits the biological question, and in cases to tackle multiscale imaging with the combined use of several instruments.</p><p>Here below, we review the features and advantages of the Lightsheet variants implemented at the Node’s instruments.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"upload/Lightsheet_imaging_Live_in_Zebrafish.png\" style=\"width: 690px; height: 607px; display: block; margin: auto;\" width=\"690\" height=\"557\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><figcaption><strong>Lightsheet imaging, Live in Zebrafish</strong>.

With a static LS illumination, SPIM enables deep, fast and gentle imaging. Commonly set with a horizontal detection arm and vertical ligthsheet illumination, it offers the simplest and most flexible readout for samples hanging from the top or disposed in a cuvette or chamber. </p><p><strong>Multiview SPIM</strong>: Most instruments enable sample rotation, hence enabling one to access the sample from the best angle, or to generate a more homogeneous and more isotropic 3D volume in large samples after multiview reconstruction.</p><strong>Double-sided illumination:</strong><p> For large samples, two lightsheets are used, e.g. from “right” and from “left”, and can be combined to improve the image quality over large fields of view</p><p><strong>Double-sided detection: </strong>Imaging large samples from both sides simultaneously enables sharper images with large samples. With live samples it results in faster imaging (no rotation), with cleared samples it extends the size of the sample that can be imaged.</p><p><strong>DSLM: </strong><em>Digitally Scanned Lightsheet Microscopy. </em>The lightsheet is produced by a rapidly scanned beam (in one direction only) to form a LS that yields improved image contrast, quality and resolution. Especially suited to work in the two-photon regime.</p><p><strong>ASLM</strong>: <em>Axially Swept Lightsheet Microscopy. </em>While in SPIM, adjusting the LS focus to the field of view brings a known resolution trade-off, ASLM enables one to<em> </em>sweep the LS waist laterally to achieve the best possible axial resolution across the entire (or larger) field of view.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>iSPIM</strong>: An inverted SPIM. The illumination and detection objective lenses reach the sample from the top (e.g. by dipping). This inverted geometry allows for easy sample mounting in dish-like or chamber-slide sample carriers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Refocused imaging</strong>: This is either a SPIM or DSLM add-on based on active optics that adjusts the image plane across large volume without moving any part. By moving both the lightsheet and the focus optically, rather than the sample mechanically, one achieves fast volumetric imaging of living samples, reaching up to several tens of volumes per second.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>OPM, </strong><em>Oblique Plane Microscopy</em>: the lightsheet is formed through the same detection lens and the image is reconstituted through an optical assembly downstream of the primary objective lens. Mounted on an inverted microscope, OPM enables to combine the lightsheet benefits with the use of conventional sample carriers (e.g. multiwell plates), hence true high-throughput and long-term live imaging.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>MacroSPIM with optical clearing: </strong>For large samples in the order of 5-30mm, imaging with cellular resolution in entire organs at variable magnifications (i.e. continuous zoom) ranging from 0.3x to 24x. Illumination and detection from both sides ease the capture of high contrast images in very large volumes. 3D Tiling enables good resolution over large volumes.</p><p><strong>Diverging LS</strong>: A diverging lightsheet fills a very extended field of view and offers to image exceptionally large sample (5-7cm or beyond) in a single scan.

The FALCON (FAst Lifetime CONtrast) is a fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) platform fully integrated in the confocal microscope that can deliver video-rate FLIM with pixel-by-pixel quantification. The single molecule detector (SMD HyD) provides a high detection efficiency. Resonant scanners provide fast scanning capabilities up to video-rate at 512×512 pixels. The system includes a white light laser source as well as a 405 nm semiconductor laser. Live-cell imaging is possible due to controlled environmental conditions. We also provide STED image processing with the Huygens software.&nbsp;</p><p>STED: The Abberior STED microscope is based on the INFINITY platform, which is built around an Olympus IX83 microscope. The system is equipped with four pulsed lasers (485, 518, 561, 640nm) as well as a CW 405nm laser. Moreover, the STED module has two STED depletion lasers (595, 775nm). The detection units are based on avalanche photodiodes (APDs) and we have the MATRIX detector upgrade, which consists on a hexagonal arrangement of avalanche photodiodes (APDs) enabling a higher signal-to-background. Moreover, we have an additional spectral detection unit including ultra-high sensitivity FLIM optimized APD.</p><p>Airyscan: The LSM980 airyscan 2 and definite focus 2 microscope is equipped with temperature, humidity and CO2 control for live-cell imaging.

Biomedical Imaging Node","description":"<h2>FINLAND</h2>\n<h2>Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node</h2>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>The Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FiBI) is a multi-sited, multimodal Node covering biomedical imaging from mouse to man. The spearhead imaging technologies of the FiBI Node include 1) preclinical and human PET imaging and PET tracer development, 2) preclinical high-field MRI, 3) magnetoencephalography (MEG), and 4) optical intravital imaging, coupled with a broad repository of imaging tracers and probes, numerous animal models from mice to pigs, and diverse stimulation systems for both animals and humans. The key expertise and main research applications focus on major challenges especially in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, neuroscience, and cancer. With wide coverage of imaging modalities and expertise, the FiBI Node provides exceptional opportunities not only for basic research but also for translational research from small animals to larger animals to humans and to the clinic within a single Node.</strong> </p>\n<p>The Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node operates in close collaboration with the Finnish Advanced Light Microscopy Node. Together, the two Nodes form Euro-BioImaging Finland, which is on the Academy of Finland’s national roadmap for research infrastructures 2021-2024</p>\n<h3>Specialties and expertise of the Node</h3>\n<p>The expertise and the imaging modalities of the FiBI Node enable versatile basic research but also provide unique approaches especially in translational research and drug development. In addition, the research opportunities in the FiBI Node also cover development and validation of new imaging and other health care technologies, new imaging tracers and probes, and new tools for advanced image processing and analysis. <br>Special features of the FiBI Node’s spearhead technologies are described below.\n</p>\n<h5><strong>SPECIALITIES IN PET IMAGING</strong></h5>\n<ul>\n    <li>Exceptionally broad collection of different PET tracers to study e.g., blood perfusion, glucose and fatty acid metabolism, (neuro)inflammation, and neurotransmission both in animals and humans. Just to mention a few examples, [15O]H2O, [18F]FDG, [18F]FTHA, and [11C]Acetate are among the most frequently asked tracers for cardiovascular and metabolic imaging, [11C]Methionine, [18F]rhPSMA7.3, and [68Ga]DOTANOC for cancer imaging, and [11C]Raclopride, [11C]PBR, [11C]PIB and [11C]UCB-J for neuroimaging. Our PET tracer portfolio is constantly being streamlined with new tracers developed in-house, so don’t hesitate to ask for more information about available options.</li>\n    <li>Numerous validated PET applications for animal and human studies:\n        <ul>\n            <li>Cardiovascular PET specialties include diagnostics, characterization, and monitoring coronary artery disease, heart failure, and inflammatory processes of the cardiovascular system. </li>\n            <li>Metabolic PET approaches provide various opportunities for studying key pathological processes such as insulin resistance and pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction in obesity, metabolic diseases, and T2 diabetes, and the effects of physical activity/inactivity on tissue specific and whole body metabolism. </li>\n            <li>PET applications in neuroscience range from neurophysiology of aging brain, pathophysiology of neurogenerative diseases, mapping neuroreceptor systems in health and disease, molecular and functional processes (e.g. neuroinflammation) of different psychiatric and neurological disorders, to neurobiology of human behavior and emotions. </li>\n            <li>Oncological PET expertise offers opportunities to assess and validate new hybrid imaging methods and image acquisition protocols in cancer diagnostics, and to develop new theranostic approaches for various types of cancers, such as prostate and breast cancer, neuroendocrine and other somatostatin receptor positive tumors, and malignant lymphoma.   </li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h5><strong>SPECIALITIES IN PRECLINICAL HIGH-FIELD MRI</strong></h5>\n<ul>\n    <li>Body movement tolerant, in-house developed technology for fMRI of awake animals. The technique allows for example diverse genetic, electrical, and pharmacologic manipulations and at the same time overcomes the interfering effects of anesthetics. It is minimally stressful to animals and it can also be combined with various brain stimulation or electrophysiological recordings providing flexible study designs. </li>\n    <li>Hyperpolarized MRI, a non-radioactive method for investigation of dynamic metabolic processes. The Node houses DNP-hyperpolarizer for 13C-labeled probes, such as pyruvate. Hyperpolarization increases MR sensitivity of 13C nuclei over 10000-fold for 1-2 minutes which allows real-time imaging of pathway-specific metabolic processes, where the injected probe is observed separately from its metabolites. Therefore, hyperpolarized MRI has applications in many diseases with altered metabolism including cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and a variety of inflammatory conditions. </li>\n</ul>\n<h5><strong>SPECIALITIES IN MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY (MEG)</strong></h5>\n<ul>\n    <li>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is optimally suited for detecting neuronal dynamics in the cerebral cortex, which has made it a powerful tool in basic neuroscience research. The FiBI Node offers MEG-optimized experimental designs coupled with a wide range of sensory, motor and cognitive stimulus systems. The offered protocols can be used to study for example sensorimotor and proprioceptive brain activity related to body movements, cortical networks in language processing, and neuronal signaling of cognitive functions in health and disease. MEG is routinely combined with other complementary measures of human neurophysiology such as fMRI, EEG, TMS, and eye-tracking as well as with diverse behavioral measures.</li>\n    <li>Unique opportunities for MEG related imaging and neurotechnological development. New types of MEG sensors, hybrid MEG-MR systems, and next-generation MEG stimulator systems and monitoring devices are actively being developed in house.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5><strong>SPECIALITIES IN OPTICAL INTRAVITAL IMAGING</strong></h5>\n<ul>\n    <li>Multiphoton, widefield and intrinsic signal optical intravital imaging set-ups for studying e.g. ear skin vasculature, paw skin, brain, lymph node/mammary gland, tumors, and externalized internal organs such as the intestine, liver and spleen, and protocols and adapters for both anesthetized and behaving animals (brain imaging). These techniques can be used to study for example vascular networks, blood flow and leakage, cell tracking, and morphological changes in longitudinal settings. Advanced neuronal set-ups for brain imaging allow for example dynamic imaging of calcium- or voltage-sensitive proteins, micro-anatomic imaging of dendritic spines and mitochondria, and blood oxygenation and blood flow rate imaging. Brain imaging can also be performed in freely moving animals by using in-house developed home-cage device, where the animal can be exposed to cues, perform tasks or interact with other animals and coupled with physiological recordings. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>New offer of technology</h3>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/content/isidore\" target=\"_blank\">ISIDORe</a> is a Horizon Europe funded project that brings together 154 partners from 32 countries around the world, and is designed to effectively support research on infectious diseases and increase preparedness for pandemic.</em></p>\n<table class=\"centered\">\n    <thead class=\"table-head\">\n        <tr>\n            <td>Technologies</td>\n            <td>Euro-BioImaging</td>\n            <td>ISIDORe</td>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr>\n    <td>micro-MRI/MRS (&gt;= 7T)</td>\n    <td>✓</td>\n    <td>✓</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>micro-MRI/MRS (&lt; 7T)</td>\n    <td>✓</td>\n    <td>✓</td>\n  </tr>\n<tr>\n    <td>micro-CT</td>\n    <td>✓</td>\n    <td>✓</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>micro-PET</td>\n    <td>✓</td>\n    <td>✓</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>micro-US</td>\n    <td>✓</td>\n    <td>-</td>\n  </tr>\n  \n  <tr>\n    <td>in vivo Optical Imaging</td>\n    <td>✓</td>\n    <td>✓</td>\n  </tr>\n \n  <tr>\n    <td>micro-PET/MRI</td>\n    <td>✓</td>\n    <td>✓<br></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>micro-PET/CT</td>\n    <td>✓</td>\n    <td>✓<br></td>\n  </tr> <tr>\n    <td>micro-SPECT/CT</td>\n    <td>✓</td>\n    <td>–</td>\n  </tr>\n <tr>\n    <td>Intravital microscopy (IVM) - Med</td>\n    <td>✓</td>\n    <td>–</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>MRI/MRS (&gt;= 7T)</td>\n    <td>✓</td>\n    <td>–</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>MRI/MRS (&lt; 7T)</td>\n    <td>✓</td>\n    <td>✓<br></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>MRI-PET</td>\n    <td>✓</td>\n    <td>–</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>MEG</td>\n    <td>✓</td>\n    <td>_</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>PET</td>\n    <td>✓</td>\n    <td>✓</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>PET/CT *</td>\n    <td>✓</td>\n    <td>✓<br></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>micro-MRI/MRS (&gt;= 7T) - ex-vivo</td>\n    <td>✓</td>\n    <td>–</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>micro-MRI/MRS (&lt; 7T) - ex-vivo</td>\n    <td>✓</td>\n    <td>–</td>\n  </tr>\n  \n  <tr>\n    <td>micro-CT - ex-vivo</td>\n    <td>✓</td>\n    <td>–</td>\n  </tr>\n  \n    </tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Additional services offered by the Node</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>User-oriented project support with study design and management</li>\n<li>Synthesis and development of radiotracers and radiopharmaceuticals</li>\n<li>Various animal models for human diseases (e.g. mouse, rat, rabbit, and pig models)</li>\n<li>Advanced animal experiment facilities</li>\n<li>Assistance in patient and subject recruitment</li>\n<li>Assistance in acquiring ethical permissions</li>\n<li>Blood and tissue sampling, metabolite analyses, and pharmacokinetic modelling</li>\n<li>Electrophysiological and behavioral measurements such as electroencephalography (EEG), navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS), and eye tracking </li>\n<li>Wide variety of behavioural measurements</li>\n<li>Basic and advanced training for using the equipment</li>\n<li>Assistance in image processing, data analyses, and interpretation</li>\n<li>Data storage\n</li></ul>\n<h3>Instrument highlights</h3>\n<p><strong>PET imaging:</strong> Three whole body PET/CT scanners (GE Discovery MI, GE D690, GE Discovery VCT), human brain/animal PET scanner (CPS HRRT), simultaneous 3T PET/MRI (GE Healthcare Signa), two small animal PET/CT scanners (Siemens Inveon, Raycan), portable animal PET and CT scanners (Molecubes) and small animal PET scanner (Siemens).

The node comprises 9 separate imaging facilities spread across 5 sites, all situated within a 70km radius. Whilst each facility is well equipped for imaging in either the biological or biomedical domain, our strategy is to specialise in the particular spearpoint techniques as detailed in the section below.</strong></p>   \n    <p>The Flanders Bioimaging Node itself is funded by the FWO International Research Infrastructure program, in co-ordination with the Department of Economy, Science and Innovation (EWI), whilst the combined available imaging infrastructure from the constituent sites represents more than €50mi investment.</p>\n    <h3>Specialties and expertise of the Node</h3>\n    <p>Flanders Bioimaging aims to help develop projects for a wide range of users from academia and industry to understand disease at the molecular, cellular, organ and organism levels, and to help develop and validate biomarker tools to help guide drug development and precision medicine. Whilst our sites have broad expertise, there is an especial focus on the oncology and neurodegenerative disease settings.&nbsp;</p><p>\nOur strategy is to focus on providing access to the leading applications (‘spearpoints’) that have been developed at each site – each spearpoint is described below. \n</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>SPECIALTIES IN CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL IMAGING:</strong>\n</p><p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Translation of novel CNS tracers\n</p><p>The Molecular Imaging and Research Clinic at KU Leuven (MIRaCLe) is well established in the validation and application of novel PET biomarkers to clinical populations for improved diagnosis and precision medicine for central nervous system (CNS) disease and especially neurodegeneration. The MIRaCLe platform focuses on translating novel PET candidates to first in human studies, including full quantitation and methodology development, as well as employing established markers for receptor occupancy studies in response to novel drugs in clinical populations, via interface with the UZL Clinical Trial unit.\n</p><p>&nbsp;\n</p><p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GMP production of nanobody theranostics\n</p><p>The <em>In vivo </em>Cellular and Molecular Imaging (ICMI) core facility at the VUB specialises in the development of new Nanobody-based (Nb) optical and nuclear diagnostic imaging probes and therapeutics for oncology and immuno-oncology in particular. Importantly, ICMI provides a GMP production platform for such Nb diagnostics & therapeutics, that includes selection of production vectors for (GMP-grade) Nanobody productions; Nanobody fermentation and purification protocols with qualification of in-process controls (IPCs) and analytical tests for follow-up and release; GLPgrade Nanobody batch production for <em>in vivo </em>PET imaging proof of concept studies and to support toxicity and stability studies and finally production of GMP-grade Nanobody batch that can be used for clinical translation.\n</p><p>&nbsp;\n</p><p><strong>SPECIALTIES IN PRECLINICAL IMAGING:</strong></p><p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Multi-modality image-guided radiotherapy</p><p>CORE ARTH (Animal facilities Radiological Techniques & Histology) Infinity at the University of Gent houses the SmART+ system for small animal irradiation, a unique system in Europe that combines multiple imaging modalities to allow the determination of biological target volumes (BTVs) for radiotherapy planning using non-uniform dose delivery protocols for automated nonhomogeneous doses.\n</p><p>In addition the facility has established pipelines for the integration of PET and MRI biomarkers to inform such higher dose delivery with the goal of targeting the more malignant or more radiation-resistant tumour areas. This comprehensive imaging biomarker platform also allows the monitoring of combination radio/chemotherapy responses and thus the validation of predictive imaging biomarkers.\n</p><p>&nbsp;\n</p><p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PET and High-field MRI characterisation of CNS disease models and therapy response</p><p>The <em>in vivo </em>small animal imaging facilities of the University of Antwerp consist of the Molecular Imaging Centre Antwerp and the Bio-Imaging Lab (MICA-BIL), and provides a battery of early biomarkers to evaluate neurodegenerative diseases, cancer as well as treatment response in a range of preclinical disease models. MICA-BIL makes use of PET biomarkers for the visualisation of proteinopathies, neuro-inflammation and presynaptic receptor density and combines functional connectivity and activity, structural integrity and connectivity from MRI. Fully optimised scan protocols and processing pipelines are available, including multi-modality integration to both increase predictive power and better discriminate underlying disease mechanisms and enable the early evaluation of potential treatments.</p><p><strong>SPECIALTIES IN BIOLOGICAL IMAGING:</strong>\n</p><p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Enteric Nervous System Imaging:\n</p><p>The Cell & Tissue Imaging Cluster (CIC) at KU Leuven integrates live fluorescence (single, two- and recently 3-photon), lattice light sheet and second and third harmonic imaging to provide multiplex real-time structural and physiological information on the enteric nervous system (ENS). The CIC is able to offer advanced (neuro)physiological imaging experimental setups involving (for example) the perfusion of drugs or electrical stimulation on widefield (incl. with high frame rate cameras), confocal, 2|3-photon, Abberior STED and Lattice Light sheet microscopes. Full protocols for physiological measurements in a range of sample types (including organs, tissue slices and organoids) on multiphoton/STED/LLS microscopes are available and extendable to allow pharmacological/electrical interventions at defined and accurate (ms) timepoints, with full analysis pipelines for the extraction and interpretation of valid physiological information from non-linear, superresolution and high-rate/noisy imaging data.</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Correlative Light/Electron Microscopy:\n</li></ul><p>The Biological Imaging Core (BIC) at the Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnology (VIB) houses a Zeiss Elyra 7-Structured Illumination Microscope (SIM)² equipped with the LSM980 two-photon module to enable accurate correlation of super-resolution light microscopy with EM data. This allows defined region study at resolutions ranging from 60nm (SIM²) to &lt;20nm (PALM/d STORM) to nanometre ultrastructure via SEM, with Focused Ion Beam SEM (FIB-SEM) available to allow applications under cryo conditions. This dynamic 3D/4D super-resolution microscopy platform closes the resolution gap between LM and EM, expanding <em>in situ </em>structural analysis, and enables the correlation of protein clusters/complexes with morphological domains in organelles and tissues. Imaging neurodegenerative processes at the level of organelles and identifying the initial stages of protein/peptide aggregation, transmission and organellar involvement is a key focus, with the aim to better understand neurodegenerative mechanism(s) and identify novel targets for early diagnosis and therapy.\n</p><ul><li>Pharmacokinetic Imaging:\n</li></ul><p>The Gent Light Microscopy Core (GLiM; <a href=\"http://www.ugent.be/glim\">www.ugent.be/glim</a>) has expertise in pharmacokinetic imaging, i.e. the study of the physicochemical properties of single molecules and nanoparticles in biological systems. This technique makes use of advanced imaging (Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching, FRAP; Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy, FCS; Single Particle Tracking, SPT) with major applications in the study of drug delivery and nanoparticle therapy (nanomedicines) in a range of biological systems. GLiM also has unique and complementary expertise in the intracellular delivery of compounds, including labels for microscopy or preclinical imaging of cells, via ‘photoporation’ (valorized at GU via the formation of the spin-off Trince). A major focus is the development of techniques to elucidate nanoparticle transport mechanisms in spheroids and patient-derived tissue fragments with the goal of informing the development of a range of nanomedicines, with special focus on improved therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of cancer. Different pharmacological and biomechanical manipulations to enhance nanoparticle transport can also be studied and developed using these model systems and readouts.\n</p><ul><li>Dynamic Optical Microscopy:\n</li></ul><p>The Advanced Optical Microscopy Centre (AOMC) at the University of Hasselt has unique expertise in studying molecular dynamics via Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and image correlation spectroscopy (ICS), two powerful fluorescence methods especially suited to study the dynamics of live biological processes, enabling 'fluorescence-based dynamic structural biology’ investigations from the single-molecule scale via e.g. super-resolution, TIRF and confocal microscopes all the way to the organoid, organs and model organism length scale via state-of-the-art light-sheet microscopy. A particular focus is the application of FRET/ICS procedures to enable dynamic optical imaging in large multicellular assemblies and thus create a framework for super-resolved multidimensional correlation imaging (ICS) methods, furthermore to map viscosity/viscoelastic properties of/ diffusive heterogeneity within biomolecular assemblies below the 200-nm optical diffraction limit. Multiplex FRET combining space-and-time-resolved data recording is available to characterise heterogenous biological environments.\n</p><p>&nbsp;\n</p><ul><li>Systems microscopy:&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The Antwerp Centre for Advanced Microscopy (ACAM;<a href=\"http://www.acam-uantwerpen.be/\"> </a><a href=\"http://www.acam-uantwerpen.be/\">www.acam-uantwerpen.be</a>) develops data-driven microscopy approaches, based on a diversity of imaging technologies (incl. electron microscopy, high-throughput screening, live cell and light sheet microscopy) to gain insight in and expose novel therapeutic targets for human age-related diseases. ACAM has established end-to-end pipelines to query among others, oxidative stress and mitochondrial defects in human patient cells, synaptic connectivity in primary or iPSC-derived neurons, and DNA damage in cancer cells. High-end super-resolution and expansion microscopy in combination with cyclic staining is optimized for molecular-level investigations, while deep learning-enhanced image recognition enables cell type and state recognition in more complex, physiologically relevant biological specimens such as mixed cell cultures. A systematic workflow based on tissue clearing and light sheet microscopy allows cellular phenotyping of intact tissue mimics such as cerebral organoids and whole organs such as mouse brain. Thus, together our imaging expertise allows quantitative investigation of pathological defects across scales.\n</p><h3>Additional services offered by the Node\n</h3><ul><li>Full project support, experimental design, user training\n</li><li>Wide range of disease models\n</li><li>Large animal scanning (mini-pigs)\n</li><li>BSL2 animal facility\n</li><li>SPF facility for high-field MRI imaging\n</li><li>Autoradiography of ex-vivo tissue with a wide range of isotopes\n</li><li>Laser microdissection and photoablation\n</li><li>Support for patient and subject recruitment for clinical studies\n</li><li>Support for obtaining preclinical and clinical ethical permission\n</li><li>Full clinical and preclinical quantitation for PET studies\n</li><li>Image processing and data analysis for all spearpoint technologies</li><li>Data storage and support for metadata definitions/implementation</li></ul><p><br></p><h3>Instrument Highlights</h3><p><strong>Clinical PET imaging:</strong>&nbsp;\n</p><p>Two PET/CT scanners (GE Discovery MI, Siemens TruePoint), a simultaneous 3T PET/MRI (GE Healthcare Signa), four SPECT/CT scanners (Symbia Intevo Bold, GE Discovery NM530s CZT, GE Discovery MI, Siemens Symbia).

FBI aims at creating the most efficient adoption of the latest advances in technologies and methods related to microscopy by the users of the imaging facilities. R&D labs agree to open their technologies and expertise to the European community either by hosting users on their own site or after technological transfer to the FBI core facilities. These technologies and methods, reinforced by a strong support in computational analysis, provide quantitative measures and integrative understanding of a wide range of cell and tissue activities in biological models, from the simplest organism, to small animals in normal and pathological situations.<br>\n    Per year, we provide our ~5,000 users immediate access to cutting-edge and innovative microscopies, powerful labeling and computing methods, and appropriate training. As such, FBI plays an essential role in enabling competitive research in many fields, from fundamental questions in cell and developmental biology to preclinical research, thereby impacting a variety of domains such as agronomy, marine biology and human health. The study of human diseases is also particularly important for FBI, with many of our users working on cancer research, host-pathogen interactions, immunity, neurodegenerative and developmental

Throughput Microscopy Dutch Flagship Node","description":"<h2>NETHERLANDS</h2>\n<h2>High Throughput Microscopy Dutch Flagship Node</h2>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>The Dutch High Throughput Microscopy flagship Node brings together the three leading screening centers in the Netherlands that have extensive experience with cell-based screening coupled to high content imaging and advanced microscopy. The integration of these three sites in one NL-HTM center creates a world leading expertise center in high-throughput microscopy for imaging based screening. Each center offers specific strength and expertise. Each of these sites has developed a high-end infrastructure covering a broad range of screening and imaging technologies. Leiden Cell Observatory is in particular experienced in high-throughput high-end microscopy using automated live cell time-lapse confocal microscopy in combination with focused RNAi and compound screening strategies. The CSC is specialized in automated high-throughput imaging based screens using low resolution high-throughput endpoint imaging. The NKI Screening Center is highly experienced and at the forefront in whole genome RNAi screening using genome-wide shRNA as well as siRNA libraries and the NKI Advanced Microscopy Center integrates high-end microscopy approaches into medium throughput automated microscopy settings.</strong></p>\n<h3>Specialties and expertise of the Node</h3>\n<p>\nThe Dutch HTM flagship Node is specialized in the development and application of cell based screening assays in 2D and 3D with image-based assays and readouts. Screening platforms compromise small molecule collections, functional genomic screening collections including CRISPR, shRNA and siRNA. Special interest and expertise lies in the use of advanced fluorescence based reporter cell lines to monitor live signaling dynamics. For automated image analysis, screen analysis and data integration we have developed relevant image analysis and bioinformatics pipelines using different open sources software for image quantification. Another area of expertise is the use of quantitative data for computational modelling to obtain a mechanistic understanding of observed phenotypes. We also have extensive experience in combining HCS with functional imaging assays, employing e.g. FRET sensors for readout of second messenger cascades, receptor activation and receptor internalization. New fast FLIM approaches have been implemented on our automated microscopes as well. \n</p>\n<h3>Offered Technologies:</h3>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/content/isidore\" target=\"_blank\">ISIDORe</a> is a Horizon Europe funded project that brings together 154 partners from 32 countries around the world, and is designed to effectively support research on infectious diseases and increase preparedness for pandemic.</em></p>\n<table>\n    <thead class=\"table-head\">\n        <tr>\n            <td>Technologies</td>\n            <td>Euro-BioImaging</td>\n            <td>ISIDORe</td>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <td>High throughput microscopy/high content screening (HTM/HCS)</td>\n        <td>✓</td>\n        <td>✓</td>\n    </tr>\n    </tbody></table>\n<h3>Additional services offered by the Node</h3><ul>\n  <li>Instruments</li>\n  <li>Technical assistance to run instrument</li>\n  <li>Assistance with experimental design (e.g. experimental set up, choice of technique)</li>\n  <li>Training in infrastructure use</li>\n  <li>Probe preparation</li>\n  <li>Animal preparation</li>\n  <li>Wet lab space</li>\n  <li>Server Space</li>\n  <li>Data processing and analysis</li>\n  <li>Training workstations</li>\n  <li>Training seminar room</li>\n  <li>Biobanking, biological material storage and processing</li>\n  <li>Cell culture facilities - Safety level 1 and 2</li>\n</ul><h3>Instrument highlights</h3><p>\nSpecial features of instruments at the NL-HTM node: 1) we have both high-end confocal microscopes all equipped for automated screening and low-end HTM imagers; 2) all microscopes set-ups are equipped for live cell imaging; 3) automated robotics dedicated to perform siRNA and compound screenings are associated with the HTM imagers.

Contrast Imaging Flagship Node Trieste","description":"<h2>ITALY</h2>\n<h2>Phase Contrast Imaging Flagship Node Trieste</h2>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>The Italian Phase Contrast Imaging Flagship Node is based on the SYRMEP beamline of the Elettra Synchrotron light source (Trieste).\nThe main characteristics of Synchrotron Radiation, namely monochromaticity, high intensity and spatial coherence, allow the effective application of phase contrast techniques.  Differently from conventional radiology, where the image formation relies on the absorption properties of the sample, these approaches are sensitive to the phase shifts produced by the sample on the incoming X-rays. Phase contrast is particularly effective for imaging of soft biological tissues, where the conventional technique has strong limitations due to the poor intrinsic X-ray absorption.\nThe beamline provides two stations working with monochromatic or white/pink X-ray beam for planar and Computed micro-Tomography (microCT) imaging. A CT system based on a micro-focus X-ray source, named TomoLab, is available, if required in the proposal, as auxiliary facility.\nThe Node  offers full packages including image acquisition, reconstruction and data reduction tools.</strong></p>\n<h3>Specialties and expertise of the Node</h3>\n<p>Being part of the Elettra facility, the SYRMEP beamline is open to external users since 2000.  The beamline control system has a user friendly interface, to facilitate the access by researchers without specific knowledge of Synchrotron Radiation.\n The beamline staff has several years of expertise in X-ray techniques, image processing and analysis, matured collaborating with users and imaging groups of other laboratories.\nCompetences in application of new modalities like the low dose phase contrast CT, suited for in-vivo studies, and in dosimetry, have also been developed.\nA software package for CT reconstruction, SYRMEP Tomo Project (STP), has been specifically designed for the beamline users and offers flexible solutions to satisfy the various experimental needs.\nThe research team has also developed Pore3D, a software library for quantitative analysis of 3D images. The library includes several functions and procedures for performing filtering, segmentation, skeletonization as well as the extraction of quantitative values.\n</p>\n<h3>Offered Technologies:</h3>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/content/isidore\" target=\"_blank\">ISIDORe</a> is a Horizon Europe funded project that brings together 154 partners from 32 countries around the world, and is designed to effectively support research on infectious diseases and increase preparedness for pandemic.</em></p>\n<table class=\"centered\">\n    <thead class=\"table-head\">\n      <tr>\n        <td>Technologies</td>\n        <td>Euro-BioImaging</td>\n        <td>ISIDORe</td>\n      </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n          <tr>\n            <td>Phase Contrast Imaging</td>\n            <td class=\"center-td\">✓</td>\n            <td>✓</td>\n          </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n<h3>Instrument highlights</h3>\n<p>Special features of instruments at the Italian Node are:\n</p><ul>\n<li>The possibility to perform multi-scale Synchrotron Radiation imaging in propagation-based phase contrast modality at different resolution levels (imaging pixel sizes from 1 µm to 50 µm, according to the sample sizes and characteristics).</li>\n<li>The use of a dedicated Analyzer Based Imaging setup working with a monochromatic beam in the X-ray range between 15 keV and 35 keV.</li>\n<li>The possibility to optimize the imaging protocol and reconstruction workflow according to the specific application (using the different pre-processing/reconstruction algorithms available in the STP).</li>\n<li>The high flexibility of the experimental station that allows to fulfill different user requirements (in-situ, implementation of new instrumentation, etc.).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Contact details</h3>\n<p><strong>Dr. Giuliana Tromba</strong><br>\nSYRMEP Beamline Coordinator<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:giuliana.tromba@elettra.eu\">giuliana.tromba@elettra.eu</a>\n<br>+390403758587\n<br><br>\n<strong>SYRMEP Beamline:</strong><br>\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.elettra.trieste.it/elettra-beamlines/syrmep.html\">https://www.elettra.trieste.it/elettra-beamlines/syrmep.html</a>\n<br> <br>\n<strong>TomoLab:</strong><br>\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.elettra.trieste.it/lightsources/labs-and-services/tomolab/tomolab.html\">https://www.elettra.trieste.it/lightsources/labs-and-services/tomolab/tomolab.html</a>\n<br> <br>\n<strong>Pore3d Library:</strong><br>\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.elettra.eu/pore3d\">http://www.elettra.eu/pore3d</a>\n<br> <br>\n</p>\n<style>\n    table{\n        align-items:center;\n    }\n    .table-head{\n        background-color:rgb(164,201,70);\n    }\n    .centered{\n        margin-left: auto !important;\n  margin-right: auto !important;\n    }\n    td{\n        text-align:center !important;\n    }\n    \n</style>","country":{"id":"0af8a17e-b371-4f0b-a408-9ee57dc20943","name":"Italy","iso_a2":"IT"},"technologies":["d4001c84-4374-499e-bd2e-64fe04533ec1","2977e68f-4f59-4681-88cd-80f0c2726780","60471c07-6176-44e0-9694-259b37eb83a2"]},{"id":"72a5a9d2-809d-4f02-b0c5-ac0284316cee","name":"Population Imaging Flagship Node Rotterdam","description":"<h2>NETHERLANDS</h2>\n<h2>Population Imaging Flagship Node Rotterdam</h2>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>The European Population Imaging Infrastructure is an initiative of the Dutch Federation of University Medical Centres (NFU) and the Department of Radiology & Nuclear Medicine, Erasmus MC, University Medical Centre Rotterdam.

Our equipment enables us to image objects in 3D at super-resolution in up to 4 colours, with resolutions ranging from 120nm down to 10nm.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/platforms-and-facilities/light-microscopy\" target=\"_blank\">Francis Crick Institute: </a></strong>Lightsheet microscopy (from live organoids and embryos to \n\t\t\t\tfixed whole mouse organs), High Resolution&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Episcopic \n\t\t\t\tMicroscopy (HREM), Optical Projection Tomography (OPT)</p>\n<p>We offer two methods for imaging thick samples, Lightsheet microscopy and High Resolution Episcopic Microscopy (HREM), with support for the entire experimental workflow, including sample prep, clearing, image analysis, and  data management.</p><p><br>\nOur Lightsheet systems cover two distinct application spaces: Larger fixed samples (10 - 20 mm) can be imaged with the LaVision Ultramicroscope whereas smaller living or fixed samples (50 - 500 µm) can be imaged with either the Luxendo MuVi or Viventis LS1. The Ultramicroscope can be used in combination with antibody labelling and tissue clearing to image many sample types, including whole mouse organs, later-stage embryos, tumors, and tissue sections. In contrast the MuVi and LS1 are suitable for live imaging of small samples such as spheroids, organoids, and early-stage embryos. The LS1 offers higher throughput whereas the MuVi can image thicker samples, and has been adapted with a pulsed IR laser for photo-stimulation.</p><p><br>\nHREM is a simple block-face approach for imaging tissue and organ morphology that does not require endogenous tissue fluorescence or any form of antibody labelling. It was originally developed to characterise embryonic lethal mouse mutations and has been used to study cardiovascular, skeletal, and neurological defects in a wide variety of mouse models (eg: Vanyai et al, Development 2020.)</p><p><a href=\"https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/facilities/euro-bioimaging-uk-node\"><em>King’s College London:</em> \t</a>STORM ,SIM, Lightsheet, FLIM, CLEM,Volume EM, \n\t\t\t\tLA-ICP-MS, Raman</p>\n<p>At the atomic and nano scales, we support volume EM and CLEM workflows, cryo SEM and cryo TEM and are experts in freeze fracture.
